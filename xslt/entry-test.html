         fortis on iron or
         copper whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next make it neat
         with a burin or chisel. Then pour soft
         tin, yet unused, onto polished
         marble and flatten it, making it quite thin, with a
         wooden board. Or else pour it on a table as
         is done with lead, or put it through a roll-press. Next lay
         your tin plate over the engraving,
         and over the tin plate put a piece of
         felt and strike it with a hammer. Then gild it in the
         following manner.
