# Element Definitions

### activity
THU: describes (via attribute type) the general area of activity (e.g., varnishes; glassmaking; lifecasting; embellishing)
JMW: describes an action verb asscociated with making a product (e.g. varnish, cut, heat, paste, etc.)--I am aware that this could also be interpreted the way THU has done.
BNH: things like casting, metalworking---the realm of doing/making to which an entry belongs
NR: one way to think about the function of <activity> would be to connect it to the purpose of each entry.  For example, if the purpose of a block is "casting", then <activity> can further refine "casting". I am not sure why activity has to have a type attribute though... 

### material
THU: strictly surrounds a material (e.g., marble, iron, turpentine)
JMW: physical materials, such as marble, iron, and turpentine (what one might term 'ingredients' if we were still usign the recipe formula)
BNH: matter that is not a tool, defined at its most basic level (i.e. without qualifiers)
NR: any substance---e.g. tin, lead, varnishes, wax---that occurs in an entry;

### material_format
THU: surrounds a material and describes its particular format (e.g., \<m_f>\<m>marble\</m> slab\</m_f>; iron wire; turpentine varnish)
JMW: basically an adjective for a particular material (e.g. marble slab, iron wire), but I'm not sure this is necessary or useful
BNH: the qualifiers that assign finer distinctions to materials
NR: I understand what this element is trying to do, but not sure of its function as far as user story is concerned

### name
JMW: a personal name (e.g. Geoffrey Chaucer)
BNH: any proper noun

### place
JMW: a specific geographic location (e.g. France, London)
BNH: not sure.  A location that's not a proper noun?

### purpose
THU: describes the overall intent of the entry according to a set number of categories (making, application, advice, observation)
JMW: one of our activity categories (e.g. making, application, advice, observation)
BNH: broad function of the entry, the type of information it conveys (making, application, advice, observation)
NR: specifies what is being done at the <block> level: making, application, observation, advice.

### q

### ref
THU: used to refer to entries on other pages, subrecipes, anything else out of place

### sub_recipe
THU: describes a nested process of making; that is, it describes how to make an "ingredient" in the main "recipe"

### sup

### time
JMW: a specific length of time (e.g. one hour, two days) [Note: this is my understanding, but it seems messy]

### tool
JMW: a material implement used on one or more materials (e.g. hammer, mold, brush, marble slab)
BNH: instrument used to manipulate materials
NR: any instrument that appears within the entry; same as JMW and BNH

### unit
JMW: a specific unit of measure (e.g. 1 yard, 4 cup fulls) [Note: this is my understanding, but does it get too messy?]
BNH: designation of a fixed quantity (e.g. a pound, the size of a walnut) as opposed to relational expressions of quantity [yeah it's messy]
