### activity
THU: describes (via attribute type) the general area of activity (e.g., varnishes; glassmaking; lifecasting; embellishing)
JMW: describes an action verb asscociated with making a product (e.g. varnish, cut, heat, paste, etc.)--I am aware that this could also be interpreted the way THU has done.
BNH: things like casting, metalworking---the realm of doing/making to which an entry belongs

### material
THU: strictly surrounds a material (e.g., marble, iron, turpentine)
JMW: physical materials, such as marble, iron, and turpentine (what one might term 'ingredients' if we were still usign the recipe formula)
BNH: matter that is not a tool, without qualifiers

### material_format
THU: surrounds a material and describes its particular format (e.g., \<m_f>\<m>marble\</m> slab\</m_f>; iron wire; turpentine varnish)
JMW: basically an adjective for a particular material (e.g. marble slab, iron wire), but I'm not sure this is necessary or useful
BNH: the qualifiers that offer finer distinctions to materials

### name
JMW: a personal name (e.g. Geoffrey Chaucer)
BNH: any proper noun

### place
JMW: a specific geographic location (e.g. France, London)

BNH: instrument used to manipulate materials  

### unit
JMW: a specific unit of measure (e.g. 1 yard, 4 cup fulls) [Note: this is my understanding, but does it get too messy?]
