Black varnish without fire, without disassembling harnesses or removing metal bands from chests.

Take spike lavender oil varnish and mix it with charcoal black or lampblack and, without fire, it will mix in by itself. Apply the varnish with a brush and it will soon be dry. Turpentine varnish would work quite well but it does not dry as quickly.
