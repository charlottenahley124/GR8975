Moulding herbs and flowers

You do not need thin sheets of clay, because the herbs and flowers will not lay on it, but as it were in the air, not touching any thing from any side, so you only have need of a circle &amp; contour that is higher than for flat molds. And in this way, take heed to make it strong and thick, with the heft that you find suitable. Otherwise, it will sink in when the sand is inside. Fix &amp; fortify it well with your foot &amp; firmly attach all the joints. Then, have your flower well attached &amp; assuredly fixed to the bottom of the casting with wax that is not at all rough, but smooth, so that it can strip off well. Then moisten your flower or herb in good spirits in a tall glass.
