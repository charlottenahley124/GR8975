For bronzing in yellow and white



Take mirror tin and melt it. On half a pound of this, put half an ounce of quicksilver, and remove it immediately from the fire and grind it until it is like ashes. Wash it thoroughly in clean water, then grind it on a marble slab and soak it with water of glue de retailles. Then apply that on your wooden candlesticks and any other works you like, and burnish with a tooth. You can grind pin filings and apply them with the said glue de retailles.
