Painting on crystal or glass

They paint without any traces of oil, except for faces where they outline the nose and the mouth in very fine black work. Then they make strokes and highlight them in white, and then they apply a coat of flesh-tinted color.  As for the background, they do it in natural azur from Acre to make it more beautiful, or lacquer for a quickly-done red, or for a finer red, dragon's blood. But it is necessary to apply it little by little so that it is smooth and of one color, and in the same way for other colors. Then they apply underneath it, a leaf of topaz, gold or silver.
