Making Wood Green

Take one quart of white vinegar, one ounce of green, and one ounce of rock alum. Mix them together and pour all your ingredients into a leaded pot over fire without taking any air. Then put the pot in manure for 15 days, after which time you shall remove and boil your materials for three hours.
