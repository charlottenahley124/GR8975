Fatty earth

Founders use [this earth] to make the handles of their bells. Before it [the earth] is used, they beat it quite hard, [and] then they leave it to dry gradually in the shade for a long time. And they mold it quite neatly. But the earth must not be sandy; rather, the earth must be carefully selected and soft.
