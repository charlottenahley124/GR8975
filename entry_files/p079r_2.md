Making water against illness of the eyes

Take some white copperas, heat lightly over fire, then grind it to powder. Put the powder on a white cloth stretched over a glass, then take some fountain water and filter it through the cloth, while stirring the powder with the finger until all the water has filtered through. Then wash your eyes as often as you wish and, with the help of god, you will feel well.
