To make vermillion

Take two pounds of sulphur, and melt it, and add two pounds of mercury to it. And if this material ignites, cover it quite neatly, so that the air does not pass into the pot, then put everything for some time after into a leaded pot, into the fire. In the space of twenty-four hours, you will have good vermillion.
