Aqua fortis

Some put on for four pounds of aqua fortis matter four that is in the retort, four ounces of common water in the container, which is better than putting it into the retort. The alum is de-phlegmed &amp; calcined such that the water does not have as many dregs. Many make it without de-phlegming the alum.
