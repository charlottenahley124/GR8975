Crucibles

Those from Bayonne, which seem to be made of gr¨¨s, are better because they last, without comparison, longer than others. And since they are not very thick, one wastes less charcoal to melt gold and silver because they are quickly heated. They do not absorb silver as much as others, and for this reason, there is not much laveure to be found in them. They are also not as likely to fall over as others that have a flat bottom.
