First whitening of the painting

Apply two or three layers of chalk distempered with glue on the painting, not with a paintbrush but with a large brush as if you intended to rub it down, and leave to dry. And repeat this two or three times, then make the last layer quite even using a knife, then apply a layer of glue upon which you will later be able to put your underlayer and then paint. But make sure that your first white layer is not too thick for it would break easily. Flemish painters have such paintings made by the dozen.
