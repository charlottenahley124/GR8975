Other approved varnishes

Take two ounces of linnen oil, and two ounces of petrol oil, and two ounces of mastic, the whitest you can find, and of roche alum and crush it and take a little bit of white copperoze and put all these drugs together into an earthen pot, which should be new. Put it for a while on hot ashes and you will have a beautiful varnish.
