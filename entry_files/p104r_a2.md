Engraving on iron

One ℥ of verdigris and 2 ℥ of coarse salt and a bit of sublimate, or crush some ocher with linseed oil, and use it to cover the blade or the very neat and polished iron. And let it dry on the fire or in the sun. Then, to engrave and make it beautiful, take a small coin's worth of verdigris twice that quantity of coarse salt and about four grains of ammoniac, and six grains of sublimate, and the water must not be hot.
