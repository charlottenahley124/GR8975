Another varnish

Take one ounce of spike lavender oil and heat it over coals; take a half ounce of sandarac and grind it coarsely, and then put it in the spike lavender oil and mix it with a stick until it has melted, and then put it in a glass vial, and when you want to use it needs to be heated little by little over the coals, and before applying, lay a coat of very clear glue, and then apply it with a paintbrush.
