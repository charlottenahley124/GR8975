Infusion of anthos or rosemary

It is better to cook the flower in August and more suited to oil-making. Take as much as you want. Then put it into a bottle very well corked, and leave them to wilt in the shade for a day. Then add the first substance of wine and leave to settle three or four days; and express it all in another vessel and into this very same substance of wine, add seven or eight infusions made out of new flowers. Then leave the latest infusion in the sun for a month. Then distill it through a still. Then mix two ounces of this water with two or three spoons of white wine; but this is for the elderly. Paul the Third used it.
