Against windy colic



Take a dozen dried common walnuts and throw them one after another onto a good brazier where they may catch fire, and take them out with tongs, and let them burn and flame well in the air, and extinguish them in a glass of good wine. Then let the wine cool and filter it, then pour half of it, since six extinguished nuts make one dose. An excellent cure against suffocation of the matrix.
