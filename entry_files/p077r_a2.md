 * Dry some `rosemary` in the month of May, then fill this bowl with powder made of it, and place a lit charcoal on top. And, receive the smoke by a quite tightened mouth having closed your mouth well, and a part will come out by your nose. But if you want to purge the head also pinch the nose.  Against colds, rheums, and other maladies.
