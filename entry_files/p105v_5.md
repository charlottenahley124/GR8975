Nightingale

It will need a cage made in the shape of a barn, like the ones for larks, lined with green fabric, because it feels the cold. And to get it to eat when it is first put in the cage, you must give it ants mixed with earth in the bottom of the cage to get it used to pecking, and you can give it minced sheep's heart, and sometimes eggs, and sometimes mealworm.106r
