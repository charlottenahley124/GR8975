Bronze like tin

Take some bismuth and two ounces of quicksilver. Melt the bismuth into a new pot, as soon as it becomes completely melted add the  quicksilver and then remove it from the fire. Leave the aforementioned glue to dry, then take a piece of tin, and burnish it on a marble slab with clear water, then coat it over the wood and polish it with a piece of tin.
