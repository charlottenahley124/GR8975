To give the color of all kind of metals and woods and other things



Take touchstone and pumice stone as much of one as of the other and grind them together, mix that with a glue de retailles stronger than that used for painting, and apply a layer of it on whatever you like. Once dry, rub this layer on any metal whatsoever, then burnish it.
