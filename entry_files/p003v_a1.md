##__To varnish__



Turpentine varnish does not need any glue since it is fat and viscous and does not penetrate the wood as spike lavender  and sandarac varnishes would. Spike lavender varnish does not require any glue on iron and similar materials which cannot be permeated, but on wood and on colors which do not contain gum or colle de d√©trempe, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said glue de retailles and allow to dry, then varnish.
