p049r_a1 Lead casting

Those who cast these small items, sold in front of the churches, melt half a pound of lead on a pound of tin, and cast in a stone frame. And if they want their work [to be] whiter, they use half of tin and half of lead, but the first mixture is the best, and does not make bubbles.You have to cast it hot enough, otherwise it won't flow. Some [people] smoke their molds with a rosin candle for neat casting. The antimony makes the matter harsh and breakable. The looking-glass tin makes the work whiter, but does not make it flow more than with tin that is correctly made with pure lead. Those who make very precise lead castings use puncheons. Tintiers cast with copper molds. It is said that one makes lead adhere to glass by using resin. Some people put a quarter of tin on lead. Glass tin makes the work stronger.
