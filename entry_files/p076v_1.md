To make a very beautiful and inexpensive golden color

First of all take a very yellow orange peel and carefully remove the white parts, and pulverize it very well  it in a very clean mortar. Take the same amount of sulphur, grind all the ingredients together, pour the mixture into a glass vial, and store it in a cellar or other damp place for eight or ten days. When you want to apply it, the mixture needs to be warmed and applied wherever you like, and you will see a very beautiful color.
