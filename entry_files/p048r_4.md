p048r_4Keeping birds and animals

Take a measurement from [the part of] their body that is fleshy and more susceptible to decay, with some canvas that you shall cut according to their size and width. Having filled this with cotton and stitched it, skin them. But leave the head, neck, wings and feet of birds, and head, legs, feet and tail of animals, because those dry easily. Then use that skin to dress the mold made of canvas. Small ones can be dried in an oven or covered in sel ammoniac and (?).
