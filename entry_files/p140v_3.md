<h1>Casting of lead and tin in plaster</h1>

If you want to cast any flat medal or any animal that is not very heavy, and that must not be burnt inside the mold, you can indeed cast in mixed  plaster &amp; brique, as above; and not in plaster alone, because it contracts too much feeling an ardent fire if it is not so mixed. But, with the brick, it holds well. However, take heed to dry out your mold at length &amp; on a slow fire &amp; with patience, because there is no need to reheat it. But when your work is of flowers or other things that want their mold to be reheated &amp; set ablaze, mix the plaster with stone alum &amp; even with crocum. I have molded in very neat plaster &amp; brick &amp; it has sustained several castings.

I tried both plaster &amp; brick alone and molded en noyau with like the others. My mold was very clean, having lightly oiled &amp; rubbed my medal with spirits. I made my casting wide at the entrance, narrowing it as it goes along until it reaches the medal which is very thin. I notched the casting which embraced the medal well. I dried the mold out well on a slow fire &amp; finally, I heated it well without turning it red. I let it cool in such a way that I could hold my finger to it without burning myself. I made a line of 4 ℥ of tin, &amp; ix deniers of lead. I cast it red, and it was quite good and beautiful. Afterwards I put xii deniers of leadon top of 4 ℥ of tin. It is very good &amp; beautiful.

When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat it for lead and tin. But for flowers and other things that must be burned, it is.
