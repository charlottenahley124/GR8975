Birds

Calandra larks and all birds taken from the nest and which have not known freedom are better, because those taken with a net never sing as well. However, wild birds give much pleasure with their chanting, but they must be taken before Michaelmas, otherwise they do not live long. All get a small impostume on the fork of their tail, sometimes, which some call "gaillardise", which makes them sick and sometimes kills them, especially calandra larks. One can tell when they are sad and do not sing. It must be pierced, not with a pin, but very delicately by turning with the tip of a quite sharp feather. The calandra lark should not be without river sand, and grey sand, a little rough, is the best. It rubs itself against it and purges itself [with it].
