Lute for luting your molds

I have not found a lute that is made more quickly than this one, nor a better one. Take some of the lean earth that artillery founders and bell founders use to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy.  Soak it moderately like a very thick mortar. Mix into it about one half of horse manure and then beat it well.  Afterwards mix in one third of cloth waste or cloth shavings and beat it again quite strongly.  You can reheat your mold as soon as the lute is ready.
