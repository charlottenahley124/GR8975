Toad

Having been molded, you can take it out it without burning it, because it releases easilyfrom the mold.  Choose the biggest and the lumpiest toads.  Because they contain a lot of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, since they turn out better.  You could make your cast in one great piece, but it would be troublesome to cut.  It is best to do it in three or 4 parts, which will be thicker close to the animal, and include the most amount of edge that is close to the cast/mold.  Make as well some casting conduits all the way from the end of the cast.

Let the mold cool rather than opening it, even for thick things.
