Thick varnish for floorboards


There is a type of varnish that takes a long time to dry and is still damp up to two months after it has been applied to the floorboards. But the following varnish does not remain damp like previous ones, which were made of linseed oil from Aux boiled with garlic to extinguish them and rid them of fat, and also with wheat. And this old one yellowed over time and made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like former varnishes except that one puts in common thick turpentine
