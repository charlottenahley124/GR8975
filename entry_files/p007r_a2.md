To color stamped ornaments for trunks



The stamped ornament made from sheets of copper or latten are made with wood from a service tree engraved and cut, should you want to spend less. Next, the stamped piece is colored with the aforesaid lacquer colours of lacquer, verdet, blue enamel, and soaked in turpentine varnish. But wherever you want to make it azure, apply some fer blanc, which is more appropriate for an azure background.
