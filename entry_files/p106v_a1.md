Casting in gold

To cast in gold, crocum ferri is necessary, and more stone alum than in the following mixture. The stone alum mixture cannot spoil anything. The mold must be red &amp; close it immediately with iron presses.

Shells of crabs &amp; [shells of] crayfish are troublesome to burn &amp; have their own proper way of being molded.

When molding rats and birds, the feet, being burned, are difficult to recover, because they are small and slender. The body is recovered more easily from the mold. The feet are cast in many pieces.
