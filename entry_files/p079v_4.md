Mixture for printers

Apply a coat of antimony, and pulverize on a coat of latten, old metal scrapings, or thin plates of iron or the  iron nail heads, and continue in this way until the crucible is full. Melt it inside a four Ã  vent.  And then mix in a little tin and fill the rest of the container with lead. Build up the fire and stir continuously to make sure that the substances are well-allied. The mixture for large letters is harder.
