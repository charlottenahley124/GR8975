To properly alloy the tin and the lead, you have to melt them together, Then, mix them together a little bit at a time and throw it often on a marble tile. And when it is going well, you will see it becoming unified and shining as if it were burnished. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much lead and sometimes due to too much tin. There is some tin allied with more lead. Ordinary tin is allied with some lead.
