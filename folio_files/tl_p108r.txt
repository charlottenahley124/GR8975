To hold the cores, some [people] use wire made of the same metal as that to be cast because it boils down and is made similarly, but when it is melted or pliant the core varies.

It is very soft such that with a fingernail and it makes a powder like that of our chalk from Champagne. And because everything which is provided from the earth is mixed with some other substance, to purify it [the spalt], one boils it with somewhat large gemstones then tempers it with essence of sal ammoniac. One puts [a lump of it] the size of a walnut in a large bottle of water and
