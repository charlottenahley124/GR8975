p053r_a1Soldering a vise

It is good that the jaws of the vise should be high for use in making a long piece, and that they join well to clamp a thin object. In order to solder the nut, after you have made the bolt, you will make a long iron strip of the right thickness to fit into the notch of the bolt when red hot, and you will bend it all around [the bolt] by striking it with a hammer. Once it is well wrapped around, you will insert the bolt around which the nut is wrapped.

p053r_a2Copper

If, while in the fire and while being cast, it touches the iron, that iron will be so sour that it will be impossible to forge.

p053r_a3Lead casting

According to some it is mixed, half tin and half lead and, in order to heat it, a little arsenic is mixed in. It is cast well in small sizes in a cuttlefish bone, provided it is good.

p053r_a4Molding from paper

Over hot ashes, boil some cotton in aqua fortis mixed with sal ammoniac like aqua regia. And the cotton will become very fine, like powder. Then soak it with gummed water and you will cast quite delicately.

 

p053r_a5Almond trees, apricot trees

They grow quite straight if they are grafted. And every kind of tree [whose fruit has] pits, such as nectarines, peaches, clingstone-peaches, apricots etc., comes best by shield budding on an almond tree by.

p053r_a6Lead and copper casting

Lead and tin come out well in white chalk but the softer it is the better. That from Champagne wins first prize, and it is transported to Lyon. Burnt and calcinated horse bones cast very neatly.

 

left-bottomI believe that the marrow from the horns of oxen or sheep, that is to say, the spongy bone from inside, casts quite neatly and is better than bone.

bottomNote that any sour metal comes out better than a fat one. Also, lean sand receives it and absorbs it better than dense sand.
