Latten

Latten is wonderful to cast. It is necessary to be cast very hot. And to master it better, throw in some sal ammoniac to clarify it. You can also add a bit a red copper, and if you wish to, add in a bit of tin to make it runnier.  It always leaves filaments like melted glass. It does not require as long of a cast as others.

Moulding

It is a good thing that it be cooled on the outside, but nevertheless remain hot on the inside, because when it comes out of the fire, the air and the strong fumes from the fire do not reheat the cast well.

Casting silver

Silver requires a long cast, whereas for gold it does not matter. Silver, when soldering, withstands the water you throw at it. Whereas gold sizzles, and because of this one throws its ? on the solder.

Let the mold cool well after the casting, rather than opening it.

Strengthening flowers and delicate things

For flowers and small plants, do not use wheat oil. Instead, use some melted butter which you will apply lightly with a small brush on the back of the rose leaves, and pansies and any other flower that needs it. But one reinforces the little feet of flies and other small animals with wheat oil to make them stronger and hold up.

Strawberries 

The leaves are cast separately and then rejoined with solder.  And because the strawberry fruit is cast solid, and because of this it is heavy, and the tin stem is slender, it will not be able to sustain weight without breaking quickly. One makes the stems with latten thread and then solder them back onto the fruit.
