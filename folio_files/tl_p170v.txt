p170v_2Against plague

Against pestilential fever or poison or plague, take an ecu's weight of your opiate soaked in scabious or bugloss extract, or heavily diluted wine, if you are already ill. After taking it, you must make yourself sweat.

p170v_3To preserve oneself

Acetum paratum ex ruta baccis juniperi simul tusis Eoaceto extinguantur lateres igniti. Et vapor excipiatur ore [&amp;]naribus.  Rue vinegar together with crushed juniper berries. Pour the vinegar over red hot bricks and inhale the vapor through the mouth and nostrils. This is to preserve oneself when going into noxious air: a garment can be perfumed with this vapor in order to remove infection from a room, house, etc. And if you find yourself in a place where you do not have this preparation, carry rue and berries crushed together, then, if need be, boil them in vinegar and use as described.
