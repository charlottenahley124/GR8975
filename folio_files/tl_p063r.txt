Amaranth color

Although it is said to be immortal, white wine removes its coloration and makes it light red and the dried flower ends up white. Note that wine does so, and I have tried it. Spirits have the same effect.

Drying of oil

If the oil does not dry, put in massicot and minium. There is no better oil than walnut oil, because it does not dry out too quickly nor too slowly.

Casting

The Germans use lead from Flanders because it is very "doux". And to cast better they take lead ore and melt it, then separate the molten metal from impurities and "mine", and pour it into a separate vessel, then they make their cast with it. This is because the lead must not have been used before, but must be completely new. Some people cast into forms of iron or copper.

or new lead coming straight from the mine. They melt this twice in a crucible. The first melting cleans it of impurities. With the second, they make the cast.

Shadows

German painters shade their flesh tones with crushed jet, stil de grain yellow and ochre.

Bister

It is only employed in distemper, and is used for the color of wood.

Verdigris and another very beautiful, gay green

One must not crush it with water alone, because that makes it fade. To make it beautiful in distemper, some crush it with vinegar, but that makes it turn pale and become whitish. To make it beautiful, crush it with urine and leave it to dry. Then, whenever you like, crush it with oil. And after you have collected it with the palette, before you finish cleaning the marble, crush it there with stil de grain yellow. And you will have a very beautiful green.
