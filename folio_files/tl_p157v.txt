Moulding a bird

You must give it its pose. And to do so, place it on its side on a clay base and hide it in the aforesaid clay base and sink half the aforesaid bird in it, so that it is only showing one leg and foot, then you will apply butter to keep the feathers down and then apply some spirits.  Then cast it.  And having taken hold, clean and uncover what needs to be uncovered.  Because the feet are made of bones which are hard to burn, and which will not be able to be cleaned neither with quicksilver, nor by any other means, if the mold does not open, uncover the bottom of the foot and the toe, or the nail of the claw, and mold it witha separate piece.  Make a second cooking and open your mold and clean the bones.  Feet generally remain too weak to support the a heavy bird.  Because of this one adapts an iron thread in the foot mold which goes through the body before you cast.  In this way they are reinforced.  Some mold the wings in a frame.  Some mold the head and the aforesaid wings separately en noyau, then reattach and repair them to start shaping the bird, which will firstly have a rigid shape and support the tempered sand.
