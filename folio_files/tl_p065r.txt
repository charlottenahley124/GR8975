Shadows

 Because blacks appear in different hues, some reddish black, others bluish, and others greenish, choose those verging on yellow in order to obtain beautiful shadows in oil, for shadows are yellowish, especially those of men. And for this effect use very strongly crushed jet, which you mix with a bit of yellow ocher and white lead. Or else, after you have crushed your white lead and gathered it with the , crush the jet into it. Thus it the black will be more desiccative, and a yellowish black on its own. When mixed with a bit of white, it will be perfect for men's shadows. Blacks which appear greenish black are appropriate for women's shadows. Take then some black of  , a little sap green and some bistre, and you will have a perfect shading for [flesh tone] in distemper for a woman.

Mirror

When you paint flesh, it is useful to have a crystal mirror, which represents a lifelike image, and in which you will see if your shadows are soft enough or too crude. But do not look at it using a candle, because the light of the flame will make the shadows look reddish. The painter also learns for himself with a mirror, because he sees in it what a lifelike image can produce.

Greasy colors

After the laid-down colors are absorbed, if some part remains shiny and does not seem dry, it means that this part is greasy, and that the second colors you lay down would not adhere either, unless you scrub this part with soap or breathe on it, because humidity will make the colors adhere.
