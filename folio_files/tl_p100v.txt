Gemstones

Take white pebbles that are found along rivers, along gravel banks, &amp; paths and that are somewhat transparent. If they are perfectly transparent, it will be better. If not, use the best &amp; whitest ones that you can find. Calcine them three or 4 times in your four à vent &amp;  quench them in water or vinegar. Afterward, take a ℥ of them and pound them in a completely pure copper mortar, with a pestle of pure copper, and grind them until they become very fine and soft powder; this is a sign that they have taken enough of the substance ofcopper to give them greenness. Then in your ℥ of pebbles, add in three ℥ of good minium, unadulterated by brick or something else, and strongly pound everything together again in a bronze mortar. And in all of this, add in a gros of sel de verre, &amp; some and the common people put in sandever that they find it among the glassmakers or apothecaries. But alkali salt, as you know, is better.

In this way, the vulgaire makes emeralds &amp; casts them in sand. If you do not have a bronze mortar, crush in a cauldron of pure copper.

For ruby take goldin leaves

 

Raise your stove by two tiles all around because more heat is needed to make rubies than emeralds. And take an ℥ of white, calcined pebbles, and put it in a glass mortar &amp;, having roughly pounded it with the same kind of pestle, mix in the weight of a grain of gold leaves of the kind used by painters for gilding, &amp; crush.

Some say that mixing the gold with pebbles and saltpeter gives the color of a peach tree.

Others say that the gold has to be cemented several times and then beat into leaves.
