For painting in oil on taffeta without the oil running

One needs to make a layer of batture, which is made of colle forte soaked for 24 hours in water then gently boiled so it is not too strong. Then stir in a little honey to soften it, and bring it all to a boil. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in oil, which will soften the layer even more, and which will also serve to make an underlayer for gold. Alum water also keeps oil from running.

For whitening ceruse

Hard-boil some eggs, cut them in half and take the yolks out, and between the two halves of the white put a bit of ceruse, and tie the two halves together with thread. Then boil in clear water, and it will become black, and thus the ceruse will be purified. Some reheat it over fire and it becomes very white.
