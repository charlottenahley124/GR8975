Bleach

If it is for silver, do not grind your tartar with something made of iron, but with the handle of a hammer, because if you touch [your tartar with iron] and [end up] getting some iron in your bleach, the silver will come out red, like copper, and you will need to reheat it and put it back in the bleach.  Mix in nothing with your tartar that should not enter the bleach, because this ruins it. Do not let it spill out when it first starts to boil because all its strength is in it [at this point].  Bleach is made with one part pulverized tartar and a half part of common salt.

Crocum Ferri

To make this quickly, redden the filings in an iron ladle, stirring it often.  Then sprinkle it with some good vinegar and let it evaporate.  And without taking it away from above the fire, let it redden and take flame.  Having been cooled, pulverise [it] on the marble and return it to the heat, sprinkle with vinegar, and then set it on fire.  In this way it will soon be colored and made fine.
