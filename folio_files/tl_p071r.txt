Amber

It softens like a paste when it is boiled in molten wax, and colors when boiled with the grease of a young kid, since that the grease of a goat would break it, especially if it is glazed.

Streaked wood

The elmhas in its knotty roots beautiful veins streaked with grey and black, and the root of the maple tree as well, but the grain of the wood needs to be chosen carefully. One gives the maple wood a certain yellow color and then varnishes it.

Sugared and mulled wine



When the English have a cold, they mull wine in this way. They heat wine in a large tin pot until it boils, and when it becomes frothy, they light it with burning paper to determine if it is hot enough. After, to mull the whole of it, they pour it from one vessel into another, as if they wanted to churn eau pan√©e, and as they do it, someone else lights with a burning paper what is falling from the one vessel into the other, such that you would think you were pouring fire. When the wine is mulled enough, heat it again a little while adding a few cloves and a sufficient quantity of sugar. And they the English  drink it when it is as hot as possible in order to overcome their melancholy.

English commoners put sugar in wine as a substitute for new sweet wine, which they cannot have because, owing to the long sea crossing, the wine loses its sweetness and clarifies itself before it reaches their country.

Eau de vie

The Irish do not drink any wine because they convert it into spirits, which they use almost as habitually as we use wine.
