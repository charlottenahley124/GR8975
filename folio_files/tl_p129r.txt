Painting metal herbs

If you are in a hurry it would be better to dilute your color with a gum not too thick because its oil takes a long time to dry, and it runs if thinly applied, as you have to do with herbs. If you are still in a hurry, dilute your color with egg white beaten with fig peels; and your work will soon be dry. But do apply it thinly.

 Wormwood

 The pallid white of this herb is made from green verditer, white lead or ceruse, a bit of massicot, scudegrun, and cendr√© d'azur. Mix and arrange your color with a branch you have.

Viper color

 

It is the most beautiful snake to mold, because it has very beautiful scales, round and transparent. Its natural color is made from good verdigris well ground, with good vinegar, if it is made of lead or tin. And in the darkest parts, season this first color with a little sulfur, as you know. And if you need to lighten and whiten, like under the throat, rub these parts with a rough cloth. Because of its nature, the male ejects a kind of small lump from its backside when pressed, like a half arquebus ball, made in its genitals, and full of highly poisonous prickles.

+ Add a bit of looking-glass tin in your tin; your lizard will look as if made of silver.

Molded roses

 

Roses are molded with difficulty because of their petals, which are very delicate, weak, and doubled. To avoid this, rub them with wheat oil which is very dessicative, and once dried it stiffens and firms up the leaves to separate them and for them to withstand soaked sand. Do the same thing with flies, pansies, and other delicate things like capers.
