 as heavy as before, and it should be like a paste not very thick, it must not be as easy to stir as a liquid. This state shows you that it is cooked enough. It must boil in the middle, and all around you must have a thick mixture. If you reheat it too much your mixture would be short of body, because if it becomes red the mixture will lose its strength and it will spoil the sand. Let it cool before mixing it to any other sand.

p107r_a1Catching lizards and snakes

Take a stick, pin a net with a slipknot to the top. Whistle, and move the net nearer to the head of the lizard, and pull when it put it's head inside the net. It is more difficult to take a lizard with your hands than a snake, because lizards bite without letting go, and bite as strong as pincers.

You can take snakes with your hand, but cover your handle with a woollen cloth, because the teeth of the snake could go through a common cloth. You can recognize dangerous snakes by their blue eyes. They do not bite into water, as it is known by crayfish catchers.

The sand mixture is made of two thirds of ground plaster, reheated as it is said before, and of one part of reddened tiles which are finely ground afterwards. Use also stone alum, half of the quantity of the tiles. Use two full pots of plaster, one pot of tile and half a pot of stone alum. Do not use too much stone alum because that binds the sand, and allow sand to withstand fire without cracking or breaking. Without it [stone alum] sand would not withstand fire, you can use it for all kind of metal, but for gold add a bigger quantity of stone alum, add also crocum ferri, because they [these filings] attract gold.

All the sands you will cast, must withstand fire very well, it must withstand high temperature without spoiling anything.

It is difficult to grind stone alum, and it cannot be sieved, you must grind it on a marble slab. The white [stone alum] powder the apothecaries sell is good, it is easy to crush it into a mortar, use the pestle slowly, that way you will make it [the stone alum] very fine.

Crocum ferri must be heated into a glassworker's furnace during four days.
