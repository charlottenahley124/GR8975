Mathematical figures without a ruler or compass

 

you know how to draw a circle with a quill and otherwise with your right thumb nail and your folded big finger if you don't have any ruler, fold a paper sheet in five or six folds to use it. And if you want to draw a column, arch, oval, cartouche correctly without a compass, fold your paper so the fold is a straight line from which you draw within the relevant distance a point or a line and fill it with some ink. Then fold again the paper and rub it on its reverse and it will stamp whatever you have made. In that way, A is the line without ink made by the paper fold, B is the line you have drawn, C is the stamped one.

To write as easily from the left as from the right

 

Write in the best manner possible with some well gummed ink on as many cards as many words you want to write and when your letter is full of ink, apply your paper and rub with a tooth the back of the cards.

Enemas

 

They used to mount them with a leather handle or pocket, the best one being of cat pelt which is more padded than any other else. And then they started to fold the handle from one side and then they kept folding it and turning it on itself and in that way enema runs slowly, but this manner takes more time and is less easy than a syringe which has been discovered since then with which a man can give to himself an enema. It is true that it always gives wind at the end.
