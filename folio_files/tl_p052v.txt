or to be safer, go away until the fire is completely blown out and that everything is cold again. Because the exaltation may be dangerous. And for that moment, when you take it with some tongs, do cover your mouth with some good vinegar and have a protection and cover yourself with it. Once it has died out, put it into a cloth or a canvas made of silk and fold it and hold it to a board exposed to air and the sun will dry it. Once it is well dry, powder it in a mortar and keep  this powder cautiously Because one ounce of this one thrown on 3 pounds of melted ♁ transforms it into a finer ☉ than the other one. But there is not so much pitch. You also have to choose the oldest ♁ possible which has often melted before and finely hammered into blades or other works, and at first purify it by melting and throwing it into some honey and vinegar. The completion time for such work is nine months from Saint John's day until the 25th April.

Colors

If you want to keep them moist and prevent them from losing their initial color, pour some white wine, the whitest and the clearest you can in a bottle with some tragacanth gum, and once you have corked the bottle, mix and shake it very strongly, and leave it still until the tragacanth is dissolved. Add also some fine white earth to lighten that. Some mingle the white wine with some spring water, and with this composition they mix their colors without grinding them, and they show very beautifully on miniature works.
