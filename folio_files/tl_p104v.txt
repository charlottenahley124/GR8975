p104v_a2For casting

If you've got a big piece which does not allow an easy stripping of casting, mold it with some wax, either on the hollow side or in relief, because it is soft and hollow and so can easily be separated from the piece without leaving anything. But be sure that the melted wax is neither too hot nor too cold. Some people use for molding some wax warmed in boiled water, but while pressing the mold it bends and becomes unusable. Once you have made your wax cavity, you can cast in some very soft and clear clay, and let it dry. Then, upon it you will make a lead or tin cavity, in which what you will make will easily be stripped.

Make an axle surrounded with wheels pierced all around in their thickness and attach feathers as for a cittern or a spinet and arrange them according to the song you want it to play, leaving a suitable distance. And, turning the axle either by yourself or by a clock spring, your invention will effect itself.
