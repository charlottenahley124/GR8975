 p117v_a1To make the ashes of flowers and herbs leave molds

Some people put quicksilver inside. But, if it is a little work, or fine &amp; delicate foliage, that only has a slender issue, they make two errors: the first, that quicksilver by its heaviness can destroy some delicate tract inside in coming out, the other, that some bit will always linger inside that will make [other] metals sour &amp; inhibit the perfection of the casting. It is true that if it is to empty the mold of some large animal that has big conduits &amp; passages through which the quicksilver can easily exit, like of a bird or a serpent, one can indeed put some amount of quicksilver to break the calcinated bones of the animal in escaping, because of which the said â˜¿ will empty out &amp; not remain at all.

left-topThe asparagus stalk is so hard that most often it perseveres as charcoal. Because of this, do it rather dried out or wet it with sulfur oil &amp; turpentine, or indeed cast the little branches separately &amp; solder them onto a fat stalk drawn through with a wire.

They can be cast well in gold. But if you want to enamel them, you have to make them by hand &amp; enamel them &amp; then attach them. Otherwise, the leaves would be so pressured that it would encrust the enamel. 

p117v_a3Sand that has already been used

Do not cast it. But because it is mixed with stone allum, you can use it in the mixture of other things &amp; it can serve in place of brick.

 

p117v_a4Core molding wax figures or lead medals

Rub them with oil with a brush. But be sure that it be so softly that your medal be barely wiped with it &amp; that it hardly appear to have been greased. After rub it with spirits and heat the water with which you will wet your sand, that of plaster, brick &amp; alum, so that being sort of lukewarm when you cast it, the oil will not refuse it, as it does with cold water, &amp; do not forget to moisten your sand with it, mixing it always with a little sal ammoniac.

p117v_a5Snakes' blood

If you have to cut some snake inside a mold in order to burn it, cut it far from the intake of the mold so that no blood at all remains, because it makes a crust that afterwards would not be taken away by the same quicksilver &amp; removes impressions from your mold.
