For teeth

Sal ammoniac i ℥, rock salt 1 ℥, alum half ℥. Make water with the cornue, and no matter how little of it you touch the tooth with, the tartar and blackness will go away. It is true that it has a bad odor, but you can mix it with rose honey and a little clove oil or cinnamon oil.

Crucibles

Those from Bayonne, which seem to be made of grès, are better because they last, without comparison, longer than others. And since they are not very thick, one wastes less charcoal to melt gold and silver because they are quickly heated. They do not absorb silver as much as others, and for this reason, there is not much laveure to be found in them. They are also not as likely to fall over as others that have a flat bottom.

Against diarrhea and dysentery

Against diarrhea, it is good to use preserve of symphytum, also [known as] consolida maior. And if it is against dysentery, you can rub the temples, the hollow of the hands, and the sole of the feet with wax oil and take a drop of two of it with a spoonful of broth. The root of consolida maior, crushed and put between pieces cuts in a piece of beef, then boiled, rejoins them, as it is said.
