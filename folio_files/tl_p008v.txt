To polish a ruby balay

 

Unlike others, you don't polish it with tripoli, but with marcasite powder and oil.

Ground gold and silver

You have to calcine your pure gold with ☿ and then let your amalgam dry well and the said mercury fly off. Then crush it on marble with gummed water. As for silver you have to use it in its raw form and corrode it with aqua fortis, then take it out with a copper blade and rinse it well and then grind it with gum water.

Polishing stones

There are three wheels for this purpose, one of tin, one of lead, and one of pure copper. On the copper wheel, only diamonds, rubies, sapphires and oriental jacinths are usually polished. The tin wheel is for softer stones such as emeralds, amethysts and others.

Pewterers' mixture

Because they often mix in with the pure tin half the quantity of lead, which renders the tin deaf. To correct this, they mix in some latten filings to make it resonant.

Perfect amalgam

Take the finest sandstone you can find and make a cavity in the middle. And put in it an eighth part of ☿ and rub it and wear it down while adding some water with ☾ or ☼ until the material becomes paste-like and even harder. Then, if you want, corrode it with good aqua fortis, if it is ☾ or ♀. Then melt it again, having taken it out as you know. The ☾ will have some color, and after being melted it will leave some flecks of ☼, and the ♀ will be very fine and will have almost no covering.
