p138v_1Talcum mixed with the molds

I used the one from which I had extracted the oil. I crushed it very finely even more into a steel mortar with a pestle [which was] rough like a file. I crushed it very finely into a cottony, downy powder. I mixed it with the sand and soaked both matters together, and I casted it en noyau. It molded very clean and there is no doubt that it will withstand fire.

  

p138v_2Gold casted very thinly

When goldsmiths have to solder something quickly but don't have enough time to forge it, they melt gold and then they pour it on a cloth or on anything else that withstands fire. Then they flatten it swiftly with a hammer or another similar tool, and it [the gold] is very tenuous and it even retains the impression of the cloth.

 

Unalloyed pure gold can be cast into a medal but not into herbs and lizards or other very delicate things if it is not alloyed.

A pansy which is oiled with wheat oil can be cast with alloyed gold.

And other fruit leaves, but with branch[es] that are not large and especially the leaves, once cast, can be soldered.

 

p138v_3Imitation diamonds set into the work

Spread a fine layer of imprinting black wax on the inside of the  frame then coat it inside with wheat oil, then dust it with lamp smoke because this color should not be lustrous for fake stones. Having done this, set your stone with a piece of wax then, with a steel point, or a small finishing hammer, join the edge of the frame with the stone, so that light cannot get in but be careful not to hit the stone, which would break.
