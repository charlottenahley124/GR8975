At the beginning, it is necessary to keep it flat with a drying agent &amp; that makes it firmer.  And in this, the best thing to use is wheat oil, with which you will dawb it. Once cast, you will be able to repair it. The bodies of butterflies and herbs that have a stem &amp; leaves that are flocked with capricious &amp; downyhairs need to be daubed with the same oil to keep these flocks flat; likewise  flowers that have very delicate &amp; thin leaves because dry wheat oil makes them and rigid and firm. And if someone brags about molding anything presented to them, give them the downy head of the herb called dandelion to cast or a pappus, which comes from the seeds of burdock &amp; takes flight at the slightest sigh of wind.
