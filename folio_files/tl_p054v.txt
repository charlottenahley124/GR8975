To dry jams that are [not?] liquid, have an open tub pierced on each side with a small, square window, and pass sticks through these from one side to the other, and place on these a sieve made of strings in the form of a net. And on this, you will neatly put your jam containers. And having put at the bottom of the tub a hot coal or two, cover the tub with a cloth folded in two.
