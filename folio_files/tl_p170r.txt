perfume and similar things. But be sure that the black waxwith which you cast is hard, so it will come off rapidly when dry so you can see if it has been stamped correctly. It can be made harder by adding more melted sulphur in the melted wax, and a bit of resin.

Common medals

Relief awls are made of untempered steel, and then it is tempered. With it we beat on a matrice, not red hot on the fire as some people think, but on some steeled iron, reheated and adoulcy, that is then tempered.

Casting

Do not cast all at once because in doing so, the metal overflows and gets cold instead of going to the bottom [of the mold]. Rather, cast it bit by bit, and gently.

 Iron clamps

When you put them for the second time, make sure that the mould does not wobble.

Molds

Those with noyau, when reheated, should be placed on half lit charcoal, without being in contact with the air; like the frame molds, they need to dry in the open, and uncovered.

Thick tin pieces

They should not be casted with lead or red tin, like thin and fragile things. It is enough if they are well melted and hot. Fragile things need to be red hot and made of red tin.

How to clean closed molds

You have to leave them cool down rather than blow inside to clean them, because they hold the ashes when they are hot. Once cooled, they are easier to clean. Have a find brass wire or steel wool to thoroughly clean the guene because it is through it that you cast. Blow into it and siphon, bringing it to you. Give it volume before casting the tail with wax, then cut it.

make a tail by soldering a latten wire. The grains of a flower are quite little, so they can be removed with the chaple, but the leafs need to be peeled off correctly, then the paint will cover everything.
