For easing the belly

Prunes of Saint Antonin, and if you like you can put leaves of malva and viola, adding some sugar and, if you like, some cinnamon for the stomach.

Or in a chicken broth, add some marshmallow root. When fresh it is more mollifying.

 

Stirring together cirop de guindoles doulces with water and taking some of this in the morning eases the belly.
