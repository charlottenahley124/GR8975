To tell someone that you will teach him something he does not know, and neither do you

According to the strength of your knives, either kitchen or table knives, you will make them support a large weight on their tips laid flat arranged in a triangle, edge to edge, as you can see, and not touching the ground. And after arranging them this way, if you turn them the other way without disassembling them, the handles can also support a large weight without touching the ground. You can as well adapt this to other uses with pikes, with timbers, or to quickly make a tripod in a camp with three halberd points. If the edge of the knife marked A is turned to the left, the butts of the handles will rise, but if the edge of the same knife is turned to the right, the tips will rise.
