To make a very beautiful and inexpensive golden color

First of all take a very yellow orange peel and carefully remove the white parts, and pulverize it very well  it in a very clean mortar. Take the same amount of sulphur, grind all the ingredients together, pour the mixture into a glass vial, and store it in a cellar or other damp place for eight or ten days. When you want to apply it, the mixture needs to be warmed and applied wherever you like, and you will see a very beautiful color.

Gilding iron or tin

First it is necessary to wash whatever one wants to gild in wine lees, and then wash it once again with white wine. Take three ounces of terra merita and one choppine of white wine. Boil the matter for half an hour, and apply your colors over your iron or tin, or whatever else. Then leave to dry on a sheet of paper and do not put your hand in your materials.
