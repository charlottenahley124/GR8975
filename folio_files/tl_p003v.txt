instead of finer turpentine.  And you can add to two lbs. of common  turpentine to one lb. of good quality turpentine oil, and then proceed as usual. This recipe will not cost you more than five or six sols a lb. to make and is sold for 40 sols a lb.

This vessel is used to make large quantities of turpentine oil, that is to say a bucket an hour. And you can use it to make either regular or high-quality turpentine.  As you know, start the process on low heat. And always maintain cold water in the cooler on top.  You can sell a lb. for xii sous and the rosin, known as pix graeca, remains at the bottom of the vessel. Alcohol is also produced from this vessel and one does not even need to distill it again. You do not need a stove for this copper vessel. You need only to place charcoal around it if the vessel is flat-bottomed. But if it is rounded, you can hang on it on a trivet.

@ It is better to heat the varnish a little bit, rather than to put it out in the sun, because this makes panels warp.

@ Some say it is not good to distil in this copper vessel since it makes things green. However, when tinned, it is good.

To varnish
Turpentine varnish does not need any glue since it is fat and viscous and does not penetrate the wood as spike lavender  and sandarac varnishes would. Spike lavender varnish does not require any glue on iron and similar materials which cannot be permeated, but on wood and on colors which do not contain gum or colle de détrempe, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said glue de retailles and allow to dry, then varnish.
