Plaster for molding

When it is long to set and dry, it means that it is too fat and moist, which is what makes it shrink away from the fire and crack. [This is] where burrs come from.  The one that comes from lean earth is better. You must not store your moulds made of fat plaster for a long time, because they resemble fat earth, which when drying, cracks. The best is to reheat them soon after they have been made and cast. Moulds made of good plaster can  be stored a long time.

Repairing snakes and lizards

You could make some marks according to the form of their scales, making some bigger ones and some smaller ones, according to the shape of the neck, the body and the tail. If there is something broken, you can attach it with small iron or steel nails, and glue it with some mouth glue, then cover the whole thing with gray or black wax.  But it is necessary to let the glue dry for one day without touching it.
