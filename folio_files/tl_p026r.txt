They are better when shaped as the crucible with a narrow bottom and a larger mouth. You have to strongly crush the powder and add either some sand or some cork or even better a pure pierced wax plate because it seals well up and is more efficient. A bullet just makes a hole, the powder only is more efficient. One knows that they are stronger when kept in a dry place for fifteen days.
