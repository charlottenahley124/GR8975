p104r_a1Corroding and dissolving absolutely pure gold

Put it  regular salt with aqua fortis into a violl. Let it rest for two hours, without heating it. Put [in this mixture] tenuous gold, and draw it out as if it had been separated from silver. 

 

p104r_a2Engraving on iron

One ℥ of verdigris and 2 ℥ of coarse salt and a bit of sublimate, or crush some ocher with linseed oil, and use it to cover the blade or the very neat and polished iron. And let it dry on the fire or in the sun. Then, to engrave and make it beautiful, take a small coin's worth of verdigris twice that quantity of coarse salt and about four grains of ammoniac, and six grains of sublimate, and the water must not be hot.

 

p104r_a3Good mixture to color gold

Sulphur and small gravel as much of one as of the other, and the third part of this quantity of salt, and as much turmeric as sulphur.

 

p104r_a4How to silver plate copper and latten

Mold the silver as the gold, and put it in the oven in order to get a good gilt pot. And do not let it heat, otherwise the silver would tarnish. Once it will be well spread, make it boil in walnut oil, and then heat it a bit, and put it [into the water the silversmiths use to bleach their works].

 

p104r_a5Enameling a carnelian

Soak some wheat flour in white wine, and slop and cover the whole carnelian. Then cook the violet again, then soak it into white wine for one or two hours, then rub it and leave the part you want to keep on it, then lay on some more on top again.
