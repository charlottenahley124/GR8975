Ears

Toothache

Some put a clove of garlic in the ear on the side of the aching tooth, and after two or three hours they feel better. Others put in their nostril, on the same side as the tooth that hurts, some green skin scraped from the stem of bisaube, namely that which is under the grey one that looks like a vine.
