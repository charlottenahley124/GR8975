For pints, molds are made with white clay mixed with horse dung and wool and well beaten. Because the pints are deep half-circles, they will not be easily removed from the earthenware moulds, unlike the clay ones, which are softer.

 Vents [souspirals] are made to metal molds, and we cast all at once, so that there is no smoky black line in the middle of the dish which comes from the metal's steam and smoke when it is casted. This means that in that particular spot, the work is knotted and very often pierced. However they can fix this by soldering, as I have said. This smoke is found in the middle right half of the cast, and in earthenware molds.

The vessel can be hammered so that it will sell better, but it will not last as long.

Depending on the size of their dishes and plates, they have natches on the spoke of their iron wheels. And when they want to apply
