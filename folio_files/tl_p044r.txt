 p044r_a1The reach of an arquebuse

The proportion of a fowling piece is: 4 king's feet long and the bullet weights xviii pennyweights, the expulsion vi pennyweight of powder, its range iiii-by-xx pans and 3 and a half feet and two thumbs and around a line, which is the Paris aulne. The medium arquebuse, which is the usual one and the easiest, admits xv pennyweight of bullet, v pennyweight of powder &amp; reaches lx paces.

They mix viii or ten pounds of lead for each hundredweight of tin in the cities that have regulated guilds. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One also uses ii. lb. of estaim de glace to bind it and three lb. of broken brass, that is, copper scrap that kettlemakers make.  This makes the vessel more reverberant and it is not as breakable.

p044r_a3Arquebuse

To keep it from backfiring, clean your arquebuse every eight days, and rub it with oil, and when you draw out, wet some linen in oil &amp; put it in instead of paper.

To test it, soak it and apply it to paper, and if one or two hours later it has not died at all, it's fine and well-done.

p044r_a5Dyes from flowers

Red poppies that grow amongst wheat make a very beautiful columbine on white leather. The boufain makes a very beautiful blue. An herb which grows in hedges, which has a stem similar to flax, long and broad leaves like little bugloss, which has a violet flower verging on blue and looks like the fleur de lys, makes a quite beautiful turquin, better than azure.  Another columbine flower of the shape and size of the bugloss flower, which has a leaf like that of the pansy, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows in wheat in light earth.
