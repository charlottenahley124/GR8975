having been thusly arranged and well cleaned with brushes, put the circle of clay around the base. Then, with a roll of clay placed on the middle of the back of the turtle, as you can see, and at the widest place, divide your mold. Next, oil with your oiling brush half the half of the shell you want to mold. If you sand is a bit thick, temper your sand with warm water, so that without burning yourself you can put your finger in it without burning it. And before casting it, rub the shell with spirits. And then cast your sand and let it take hold.  And note that all things that have shells, or that are hard, or do not yield as snakes and lizards do, must be oiled to come out cleanly. The things that yield do not need this. Warm water means that the tempered sand sits better on the oil, which otherwise would not work.  With the half turtle having been thusly molded, separate it with its mold from its clay base, which you will put aside to use when needed. Then clean your half-mold, join it and flatten it like for the others. But because there will be the roll of clay, the half mold will have more than just half the turtle in it, cut and crop cleanly the excess clay and clean everything well with the brushes.  Then at the top of the edge of the mold on the side where it is cut, at the halfway mark, make two notches as you have done with other molds. And flip the turtle on its base, as it was, and secure the two legs that are not molded with iron pins and fill the empty areas around it, up to the edge of the top shell with some clay. Then place the circle around it and place a roll of clay on the first mold, a bit above the notches. And having oiled the first half-mold and its notches and the shell of the turtle, and having also sprinkled it with spirits, warm your water, temper your sand with a bit of salt water, ammoniac, and the aforesaid hot water, make your cast. Having taken hold, keep the sides of the two molds neatly together, and for each side secure the joints, which are not prone to do so naturally, with two clamps, so that when you uncover the bottom of the turtle the top joint does not open. Then open the side with the belly and the throat, in the same manner that you would open a crayfish, which is the hardest animal to mold of all animals that are molded in two parts.

If there is crocum in your sand, the joints of the molds will not join well together.
