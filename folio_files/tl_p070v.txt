Copper  and latten are ready to be cast and are at the proper temperature when, as you stir them in the crucible, they emit a very white flame and the bath is very liquid.

Some cast in well-crushed ceruse, and others in flour moistened several times with oil and dried in the sun.

 

Others, for casting in lead, use old printers' letters or types for the setting of letters.

Others add to the tin or lead a material of fixed quicksilver which makes it run.
