Portraits

To become an artist, it is necessary to draw by eye, without compass or ruler. Masters do not allow apprentices to use them.

When the priming has been done a long while ago, it becomes greasy. It must be scrubbed with ashes and water.

Perspective 

In order to tell where the vanishing point is one must lay a ruler over the lines, and the point will be where the lines meet. Some make a hole at the end of their rulers in order to fix the point by that hole while moving the ruler about. Others lay a ruler across the panel,, then on this ruler they place the tip of another ruler which, being attached to the former by a screw, will move about and reach as far as necessary without losing the point. The ruler and compass without discernment of the eye will cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

To paint a perspective in oil, you should not use a ruler, for you would smudge everything. Instead, in applying your colors you must keep and follow the lines of your first drawing.

Also, to make plumb lines, that is lines from the top to the bottom of the panel, you need to have a thread with a piece of lead attached to one end and a little hook to the other end for hanging the said thread from the top of the painting.

Painting

In order to draw and to apply the colors, especially in oil, you must keep your panel as straight as possible on the easel, since if it is tilted there is a danger that dust or impurities might stick on it. Keep the place where you paint clean and free of dust.
