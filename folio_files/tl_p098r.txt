 p098r_a1Varnish for lutes

They take a little turpentine and some turpentine oil, or spike lavender [oil], and some amber pulverized and very finely sieved &amp; proceed as with that of mastic, &amp; they add some dragon's blood to color it and turn it red. And others some terra merita to turn it yellow.

p098r_a2Borders for a Garden

You have to work the ground, then then it with a rake, and afterwards if it is dry you must wet it. Then stretch a cord clean on the ground, and along its length hit the cord with the back of a pruning knife, so that the cord marks a right line. Along its length you will make holes with an iron stake, where you will plant rosemary, its head lopped off &amp; cut to measure and thinned out at the foot.

To tin nails and other work, they file their work neatly, then in order to clean &amp; degrease it well, it is boiled in vinegar. Then they dry it with linen, afterwards they heat it &amp; pass some resin over it, which induces a shining skin like varnish. This done, they melt some pure &amp; fine tin in their tinning tool, which is a square little iron box. And when the tin is well melted and moderately warm, they throw some resin in to consume the scum, &amp; then they temper the head of a nail or something similar for a bit, and having been left in for seven or eight pauses, they take it out and shake it, hitting it with some iron to make the the superfluous tin fall off, &amp; clean it with a small stick wrapped in tow. And if it is not well tinned, you will hit it until it it hot with a piece of resin and do as before before and leave it to get cold. When the work cools down it becomes yellow, which is a sign that the tin is the right temperature. But it becomes blue if the tin is too hot. Things so tinned are of a duration, &amp; do not come undone at all, like the tinning done by leaves. But at the end of a year they can be clarified &amp; renewed by heating &amp; striking them.

Leadsmiths say that making a lizard die in the melted tin makes the tinning become very golden. Or else by adding sal ammoniac.
