Goldsmith

They bind silver filings with saltpeter which refines it &amp; does not make it brittle. But gold filings are bound with borax or, to save the borax, with lead, which refines the gold &amp; softens it, for the saltpeter would make it brittle, which it does not do to silver. This is why, in order to save, goldsmiths use it to bind it in order to save borax, which costs viii sols per ounce &amp; saltpeter costs x sols per lb.

When goldsmiths have thus bound their silver filings with salpeter, a red enamel vitrifies at the bottom of the crucible. I do not know if the copper mixed in with the silver is the cause for this. Try for enamel.

Dyers’ woad

It is grown in Lauragais where the deep soil is so fertile that every year wheat was grown there, it would lie flat for being too vigorous. This is why dyers’ woad and wheat are grown there alternately. For cultivating dyers’ woad, the soil is ploughed with iron shovels, as gardeners do. Next, it is harrowed with rakes, &amp; broken up finely as for sowing some kitchen herbs. It is commonly sown on Saint Anthony's day in January. Eight harvests are made. The first ones are better. The best dyers’ woad of Lauragais is the one from Carmail &amp; the one from Auragne. And sometimes the dyers’ woad is good in one field &amp; in the one close by it will hardly have worth. The goodness of the dyers’ woad can be recognized when put in the mouth it gives the taste of vinegar, or when crumbling &amp; breaking it, it has some mold-like veins which are as it were golden or silver. It is assayed in the dyers' vat, and to fill a vat with it, six bales of it are needed. There several flocks of wool are dyed, and if it dyes fifteen times, it is said to be worth 15 florins, if it gives xx dyings, xx florins. The good kind dyes up to 30 times &amp; commonly up to xxv or 26.
