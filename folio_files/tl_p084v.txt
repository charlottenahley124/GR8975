p084v_a1Sand

I tried the hoof of an ox, quite burned, pulverized and very well crushed on porphyry, until it is fine enough to slip through your fingers without being felt. On its own, it makes a very clean mold. But because on its own it is very dry and lean, it demands to be well wet and humidified, with a thick broth with elm root.

Dross of Iron, very burned ox hoof, and felt, all burn well in a closed fire. All three ground very finely on porphyry mold very neatly in lead, without any need to reheat it much, and by casting in a box mold either hot or cold.

Felt on its own provides a very clean mold if wet, and comes off easily. And also makes the other two come off easily

A fat metal needs lean sand.

Some people think that salt water is not good, because the salt releases gas when heated and as a result causes bubbles. [In this case], there is only wine boiled with elm root.

 

Sanding charcoal makes [things] come off well. But one finds that willow charcoal creates bubbles, but oak or beech charcoal does the job without making bubbles.

For casting, there is only soft lead that can be cast at a high temperature. And soft tin.

 

p084v_a4 Sand, for the most excellent lead of all, for large and small reliefs

 I took white lead and crushed it dry on porphyry, to make it very fine. Then I moistened it a lot with very well beaten egg white, so that it became like a paste, by making it stick together perfectly with the flat of a knife. I let it rest for a while.
