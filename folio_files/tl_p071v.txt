Varnish

Add 4 ℥ of sandarac and finely pulverized mastic to a half lb of aspic oil. First of all, boil your oil in a pot on a stove, and then add the aforesaid gum little by little, stirring continually with a small stick split and quartered at the end. And when you cannot collect any more gum on the end, it is totally melted and your varnish is done.  And to make it clearer, put into the concoction a little lump of camphor. It is true that with this it will not dry as quickly. Heed well that the aspic oil is quite clear and not at all fatty, otherwise your varnish will not be worth anything. You can test  it by soaking some paper in it and heating it. If the oil, which will evaporate, leaves the paper clean, without  a yellow mark, it is good, if not, it is fatty.

Sheep fat

In a certain part of England, the sheep that graze there have very yellow fat and are nevertheless just as good as others.

Spider

There are no spiders in Ireland, &amp; if one touches them with some wood that they have there, they die. That is why some rich people from England make their floors with this wood, and in this way, they do not have any spiderwebs.

Sand

The mold is very good for casting in copper. But do not use that from cutlery, because it's just sludge, but rather that of those who  mold giant shears.

Filières' stones, when smoothed by those who whet them, mold really neatly when scraped for lead. This is usually slate-colored. One frequently carries it from Carcassonne to Toulouse.
