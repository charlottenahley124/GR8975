If they are not trempées à pacquet, that is, in the manner described, with soot, salt, &amp; vinegar, they will not be good. The large square files used by locksmiths to draft their work are only made of fer doulx, But the soft files should be made of steel.

p067v_3Essential oils

 

Walnut oil mixed with an equal quantity of turpentine and distilled with an alembic produces an essence whiter than common water. But this has no body &amp; does not unite colors, which are immediately imbibed, and then color is left unable to grip and fades away. Imbibed thus, they would not let you work with or soften them, anymore than in distemper. But you can rectify this flaw by giving it a little body with turpentine, but not as thickly as you would use for varnishing. And thus you can work with azur d’esmail, &amp; make perfect lead white. Turpentine varnish made from this oil dries within one hour.
