In order to mold well, it is necessary to cast several medals together in a large box mold, because when there is a lot of material and the crucible is almost full, it becomes hotter. Then, if you do not succeed with one of the medals, another will be good.

It is better to melt with a bellows furnace than with a wind furnace, because it heats more vigorously. It is true that latten melts better in the wind furnace, because it is more brittle than copper.

 

Some founders superstitiously believe that there are only three days in a week that are good for melting, that is, Tuesdays, Wednesdays Thursdays, and Saturdays. For them, the others are unlucky.

When you mold, do not excessively pound on the medal that is in sand, because that prevents it from being cleanly stripped, and cracks the mold.

See to it that sand does not go over the edges of the box mold, because if the molded medal is higher than the cast, metal will not easily enter the form. Therefore, always take care that the surface of your cast surpasses the mold in a straight line. To accomplish this, if you wish, put a piece of cardboard of whatever thickness you please on top of the mold.

To prevent their large casting works from becoming too porous, founders are careful to heat their molds very well. And to know if the molds are heated enough, they tap them with their finger, and if they start ringing like a pot, they are heated enough.

 

In order to cast their canons cleanly, they mix with their founder's earth some fine casting sand, if they can get any.

The sand generally considered good is the one found in a vineyard near Pech-David. But the best is the one is from the Touch, a river close to Saint-Michel and Blagnac, in a vineyard at a high altitude. This sand is thinner, and a bit greasier than the other, and better for small works. It should not be overheated.
