from one leg to another, so that the spread out limbs are in connection with one another due to the aforesaid casting conduits, which you will start in the waxless round parts that you have put at the edge of the legs to attract the metal.  In this way, because you are casting in wax, there is no danger chipping any part of the molded animal.  It's quicker to make the wax casting conduits thus, because in this way you can cast the second mold after the first, rather than wait to do them the conduits after the mold has been recooked, because then, if possible, you will need to have everything ready.  You need to heat well, and even redden the molds where there are wax conduits so that they melt and leave nothing inside.

Openwork carcanets

You can mold them "en noyau" like crayfish, first with one side being made higher with clay, which is hollow, and then you open it from the other side and make the second casting.  You can just as well cast them "en chassis", provided that they release well. If they do not, you can do a rough cast in wax, or you can fill up the cavities which do not release well with wax or clay.

Iron filings 

Because usually filings are mixed with impurities, it is good to heat them over fire to burn the filth and then wash them in clear water. In this way, the dirt will rise to the top of the water, which you will throw out, and the good filings will go at the bottom.

Carnations

Because those that you usually cast are generally quite big, they are heavy.  And so for these, you make them with silver leaf or slivers.
