p112r_1To temper the sand

You should have: a large basin full of water to dip the molds into in order to open them, a tankard full of common water, a dish to temper the sand, a small wooden spoon to pick up the mixed sand in the dish.

p112r_3Molding en noyau. Mixing of sand

Once you have reheated your sand, that is the plaster, the stone alum and the brick, and once you have finely filtered them through a cloth sieve, # mix them the following way: take four measures of plaster, two measures of bricks, and one measure of stone alum. Mix them all together with the hands, so that one may not discern one [ingredient] from the other. Once your sand is ready, you need to kill the animal that you wish to mold in this way.

p112r_4Killing the animal to mold

You must have been careful not to hurt it while capturing it. If you have a stock [of animals] and you wish to keep them for a long time, place it in a glass bottle with bran or in a large barrel half full of damp fresh earth. Give them frogs to eat, live rather than dead, because should you keep them without feeding them, they would wither and become emaciated, and their skin would become saggy and wrinkled. Therefore, the sooner after its capture you mold it, the better it will come out. And kill it in the following manner: place it in a clean bottle or vessel so that [the animal] does not carry any dust; fill [the bottle] with enough good vinegar and urine so as to cover [the animal]. Shake [the bottle] and torment [the animal] inside there until it is dead which should take an hour or half an hour. But if you are in a hurry

left-bottomTo know if [the animal] is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take it by the tail. If it moves its tail, do not mold it because it still has feelings, and when pricking [its members], it would remove itself and harm the mold.
