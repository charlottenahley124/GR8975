Casting



When you make a cast of delicate animals, like snakes, start by casting the belly side, or the under-tail, for this side has straighter lines which are easier to rework than the back side, which is more veined and is more marked.

Repairing burrs



Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a chaple or a burin, then scrape the burrs with the side of a burin, or carefully with a small file, and rub with willow coals and small brushes. Continue, also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.

Leaded silver



A lot of silver is wasted because of the lead which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the charcoal which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt silver coins, like reals and others, and make them into ingots prior to casting lizards or animals, for it comes out better. I cleanly molded a small, silver viper, like in the first recipe above. And at the end of the line of 4 reals (of 20 S of Spain), and one coin of 20 S from France.

Blowing



When you smelt silver and gold do not blow too hard or with force, because the charcoal will become spent and the crucible will sink and, potentially, spill over. But when your mold is ready, blow strongly in order to properly heat the silver or gold. When all are melted it is necessary to blow over the top with a small bellows, doing the same for gold, for it removes and reduces the smoke.
