Portraits in Wax



If you do not mix your wax with any color dye, and if you paint some colors on the wax, these colors would fade if you cast it en noyau. But the representation is not damaged, rub it very lightly with spirits diluted with hot water. If your representations are varnished, repeat the molding process two or three times in order to remove this varnish which sticks to the mold. When the varnish is removed, your mold is very clean. If your representation is set on wood, it is necessary to pour very hot melted wax on the wood, otherwise the mold sticks to the wood. It is much better to mix your white wax with white lead than ceruse, because white lead is whiter and more firm.

Chasing tool



If a chasing tool has passed through any part of the representation, it is necessary to rework the whole thing and follow it all again. Otherwise it would look like an additional piece.

Fish glue



Beat it very finely and thinly on a well-cleaned anvil, then dilute your glue with spirits, put the mixture on hot ashes, and on a low fire, it will melt very soon. If the glue is not strong and thick enough, add spirits in greater quantity. Do not melt it in a fatty pot, but in a new pot if possible. It melts on fire and dries very quickly on fire. When your glue sets on the work, heat it away from fire, it will stick very strongly. One reworks flowers and delicate things made from silver, gold, tin and other metal with this glue which will not spoil your work.

Tin and lead



They must be beaten out very finely and tin will not get brittle or break, lead is a bit fatter. But that is why it is necessary to reheat it under hot ashes, and to beat several leaves together.
