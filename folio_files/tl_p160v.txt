p160v_a1Moulding a foot or a hand

Mix resin to the wax. Once well blended, soften the mixture in hot water or urine. Then press [the foot or the hand] in the mixture in order to get an impress, then pour plaster; the cast will which will be clean and come off easily.

 

p160v_a2Fine work made of gold or silver

You can mold flies by hand,without casting; the wings and the feet can be soldered, which you could not do with fine works of lead or tin, because they would melt. You can enamel the work made of gold.

 

p160v_a3Catching crayfishes

On the end of a stick, attach pieces of liver or lung, from beef or mutton. Then hang a basket to the stick with a little string. Put the basket into water where crayfishes eat; they will soon aggregate on the flesh. Pull very gently your stick out of the water; the crayfishes which will try to return to the water will fall into the basket.

p160v_a4Catching passerines

If they sleep in the farmyard, like they commonly do, close to the house, let the closest window open, and put a lighted candle close to the window. The candle itself must be hidden, only its glimmer must be seen through the room and through the window; all the passerines will then lock themselves into the room. But the night must be very dark, without any moonlight.

  

p160v_a5Catching birds

During winter, when birds have molted, skin them and fill them with cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your birds on trees, have some [look like they are] singing, [look like they have assembled] and are numerous.

the oven must not be too hot. This [method] is good in the summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they [birds] could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the winter, because they dry by themselves.
