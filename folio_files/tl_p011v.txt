Applying the color of Damascene steel on knives

Rub the steel with common aquis fortis mixed with earth.  After, rub everything with ashes or sand. Do with the gold and silver as you would do on a touchstone.

Getting rid of red eyes or black eyes

Make two small licks of raw mutton flesh, and with a blindfold, apply it at night on your eyes.

Applying unpolished gold

There is nothing better than the black varnish of sword-makers to use as a base layer because it dries quickly and makes the gold appear very beautiful.

Making diamond points for engraving

These are for sketching what you want to draw on stones and for engraving. When these points are too dull and cannot engrave, it is necessary to rub diamond against diamond; one can rub them with pumice stone powder. It is necessary to strip what you want to engrave on a lead wheel or with a stone or with glass, because the polishing is like varnish or glass and stops the diamond or sapphire from engraving well. This is why it does not engrave easily on horn, which is polished and fat.  But when the polish has been taken off, it is easy to engrave.

Polishing a copper wheel

Instead of polishing your stone, it is necessary to remove the grease by rubbing the flesh side of a piece of leather on the wheel, all while spinning the wheel if you have not worked on it in a long time.
