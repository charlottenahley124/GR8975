Tanner

Tannersuse small skins of lambs and young goats

nearly as delicate as parchments and they keep them in some humid places and keep wetting them. When they want to print some stories on it they lay them in their molding hollows of their figure and then on top they spread some greasy fine earth used for trimming wool fabrics, well pressed and beaten and slightly humid and soft and then put on the earth a small  one-piece board and put the whole under a press and leave that dry there. After the earth the leather only remains very neatly printed [missing word] of the size of a pea. And then apply on the leather two or three black copperas and iron scale layers one after the other like the tanners do. And since this tincture is astringent and shrinks the leather will be stronger more more easily printable. Once dried stick on the reverse some fabric with strong glue, and by doing so one can quickly imitate big statues and very fine medals and paint them and [illegible] and are light and can be carried and last for a long time. What can be printed on a relief can be made differently and can be reheated with a hot iron tool.

Painter

Good crayons are not made with glue but with women's milk.

Images made of card have to be dipped in some very fine and clarified melted rosin once they have dried. This strengthens them or they will turn flaccid in wet weather.

Venice masks are made with a molding hollow and the face covered with copper.

The Flemish do not use other white colors for oil painted skin colors after some white lead for the ceruse turns them yellow.

The 4 or 5 years old and clear nut oil is the best anti-dust color. The one slowly squeezed from the press similar to almond oil is white even if the nuts' skin is peeled off.
