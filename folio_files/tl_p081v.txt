Brick alone, quite finely sifted, and rubbed together, is good for casting lead and copper, when diluted with urine. This whitish brick should be used.

 

p081v_a2Make copper and latten flow

At the end of the casting, as it is very hot, add some salt ammicke and saltpetre, it is a way to remove grime. Mix some clay with the latten. The metal must not touch the iron or the latten of the frame, but covered with sand or luth, it makes a very homogeneous cast.

Calcined black pebbles from the river are good [to use] for lead. But they are weakened if used with metal.

There is only ardille clay with which one can make tiles, recooked and reddened and passed through a long narrow bag carefully soaked with raw egg white.

Willow charcoal is excellent with sand [and] lead.

Latten flows better.

p081v_a4Cast of the frame

It is good to make it with bow wood. Turn it in order to make it homogeneous, as that is important for the casting. Cover the mouth of the frame with clay or sand, so that the molten metal, copper or lead, do not touch at all the iron or latten of the frame, because it would turn it sour, and make it filled with bubbles. Always cast higher than the mold. Pay attention that the cast is not too wide or too deep because the narrowest is the best one. Because when it is large, the weight of the matter which runs breaks and spreads the mold and fills the matter with bubbles. When you have casted, gently hit your frame, so that the matter spreads better. Black lead [de saulmon] of the first melting, works very neatly.
