p068r_1Fanciful tables

You can make various grooved compartments &amp; on these, paint fishes naturally &amp; with color on simple carton  &amp; if you wish, on silvered and burnished paper to represent the scales. And next, cover them with very clear lantern horn. You can apply the very same to other works.

 

p068r_2Planting trees

 Trees need to be planted in dry weather, &amp;  a lot of earth gathered all around their feet, like a mound, so that the rain won't fill the holes &amp; drown the trees.



p068r_3Casting

I have tried four kinds of sand for lead and tin: chalk, crushed glass, tripoli and burnt linen, all four are excellent. As to the chalk, it needs to be of the softest kind available, like the Champagne chalk used by painters. It releases very cleanly, needs not be dampened with magistry or with anything else, but is used in its natural dry state and finely pulverized. The first cast is always cleaner, however it will sustain two or three castings. Should you only cast once, keep in mind, while remaking your box mold, to take powdered chalk that has not yet been used, since the one previously used in the box has dried out and will not bind and hold together as well as fresh chalk. Crushed glass can be made from ordinary glass sand, however cristallo glass is more excellent, because common glass contains saltwort only, while cristallo glass contains both salt of tartar and saltwort. Both of them help the fusion, during which the glass is calcinated and reduced to its prime matter. In order to calcinate it perfectly, throw your pieces of glass, of whichever sort, among the largest possible glowing coals, unless some other violent heat source is available. And once the glass is red hot, throw it into water.
