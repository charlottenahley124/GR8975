Painting weapons

Black charcoal mixed with white lead is very appropriate for painting weapons, also mixing in a little azure if you wish. Charcoal by itself is somewhat bluish.

Painting crepe

First you need to make a greyish background using charcoal black mixed with white lead and a little azure. Then, after drying, highlight with strokes and lines in white lead.

Folds in clothing

You must take care not to represent any folds falsely, but rather imitate natural effects. Thick cloth hardly makes any folds, taffetas and silk cloth make more, and crepe more still. Observe which folds go lengthwise and which across.

Siccatives

White lead and massicot are most siccative, nevertheless they need a good two days. If you want to verify whether an oil is siccative, use it to distemper white lead, and if it soon produces a crust it means that it will dry.

Double layers

Azures, flesh tones and reds are applied twice. Other colors are not.

Mending cracks in a panel

If a painted panel breaks you can glue it well on the reverse, but to fill in the cracks properly in order to paint and repair it, you must not use any glue , which weakens in damp weather and would swell when touched with the oil of the painting. But have some white wax, which is harder than the other sort. The oil mixed into the wax prevents it from melting in the sun. The wax must not be hard, but soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks and crevices with the tip of a knife, then scrape.
