The sand near my area is very excellent. But in order to make an excellent work, take it fresh, hardly having been used. Because it dries out after having done a casting several times &amp; is arid &amp; has no body at all. If you cast some fine work which has hardly any thickness, your copper matter must be very hot so that it penetrates and runs.  Some people mix lead within this molten metal, but this is for large works &amp; not for small ones.

Sand from bulls' feet twice-burned and finely ground melts more neatly with copper, &amp; without a coating, than sand that I've seen. I cast a medal with quite high relief in it, and slender, with the thickness of a knife blade or a card.  And there being a hollow on one side, the obverse, with the relief being on the other side.

 

Lean sand needs to be more moistened than others, that's to say with magistra or good pure wine or wine boiled with elm tree roots or something similar. But very fine sands, like burned linen which is fat and soft of its own accord, want to be applied dry.

All moistened sand needs to be very beaten and tumbled in order to make it fine &amp; flattened of the little globules that it makes in itself when it is drenched.

The olive oil that some people mix in with beaten egg white makes it puff out.

Sand of calcined glass lasts for many fusions.  But there are only the first ones.  It also puffs out.

Latten works well on its own, but it charges.  It is good to mix it with some copper, about a quarter part, with frying pan material.

Founders cast box frames well up to about 30 or 40 pounds.  But no more.

left-middleIt is good for big work.  But for small it is troublesome to take away.  This is because it crumbles.  It would be good for it to be a little glued together with something fatty that binds, like molded tripoli or burned felt or salt ammoniac or tripoli &amp; similar things.
