Horsehair sieves

They are made often in Normandy with horsetail hairy that they clean with some washing water because they pick them out with their mouth and separate short and broken ones. They do not make the  thread longer than the sieve and it is round. They attach the black or white hair at the two edges of the thread, according to the piece they want to make. And the thread is woven above and below like any other fabric. And passing a small flat stick of ii or three fingers wide between two, they pass between after two bits of hair at each step strike and weave with three steps. The entire sieve is made of xvii bits of hair. They sell them by dozens and each xxx sols. They bring them to Toulouse to send them then to Spain and there, they exchange it with silk.

Excellent water against the pest by the Master of Montorsin 

Take some theriac rue, dittany and good vinegar, put the whole in a glass bottle and leave it half-open and well attached. And put it in a bath for three or 4 days. Then take some of your brew from its container when you need it and pour some, when necessary, on a red hot tile and receive the vapor and also perfume your clothes. This is a very precious and proved secret.

To stick stones, some do not use gem and pitch black rosin because it is too greasy, but they use as much rosin and sulphur and the same quantity of 

wax and then add finely ground brick. Others some white chalk and crushed and powdered and sieved white stone.
