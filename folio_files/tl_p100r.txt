Gold color

To very quickly make a layer of or surmat on canvas or on other oil panel, one [exposes] walnut oil under the sun or on the fire to make it fatty, as previously mentioned, for it thickens by itself in this way, despite having neither lead, nor ceruse. And with it, crush massicot, mine, &amp; other desiccants, but not vert-de-gris nor orpiment, for they make the gold die. It will quickly be dry. However, if the weather is not serain and dry, do not shade it, for if the weather is dewy &amp; humid, it will turn black.

Portrait-painting from nature

One must carefully observe the eyes, the nose, and the beard, since these three things contribute much to the resemblance.

Gemstones

Your materials need to be pounded in a thick glass mortar coated with mastic &amp; encased into another wooden mortar, so that it does not break; this can be useful to perfumers. &amp; use a glass pestle too.

Vitrified saltpeter



Melted with pebbles, it makes the glass very white. But rather, it needs to be calcined on a hot tile or paddle. And mix the liquid remains of the vapor with as much white, calcined pebbles. It is true that, in the little oven, it does not make it very clear. But for big windows, it makes the glass very clear, &amp; white &amp; clean.

Windows through which the sun will not pass

Take the aforementioned calcined saltpeter &amp; expose it to a humid air or place, and it will convert itself into a liquid which, if rubbed on both sides of the windows, the sun will not pass through; rather, it will cast shade. One needs to put the saltpeter on any clean place, &amp; put glowing coals on it, and continue all over until it no longer burns.

It also serves for melting &amp;for adding in with alkali salt for cleaning hands.
