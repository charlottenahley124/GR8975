Very strong wax

Mix with this some resin and bole. Do not cast very hot.

Diverse ligues of tin and lead

For hollow things like turtles, use half refined lead and half tin.

For flowers, use almost all lead, that is to say, a lb of refined tin, and two ℥ of refined lead.

For lizards that are as thick as one or two fingers, use almost all lead, that is to say, a lb of refined lead and 4 ℥ of refined tin.

Moulds

They are less prone to cracking while reheating when they are very thick, rather than thin, provided that thickness is sufficient. Because when they are thin, they do not need to be fired for long, and prolonged exposure to heat corrupts them. The same thing will happen if you plaster is not strong.

It is better to reheat one mold on its own, rather than heating it with others, because should this be the case, you will need a stronger and hotter fire, than for just the one mold. And because charcoal will accumulate between multiple molds, the heat will transfer from mold to mold in such a way that you will often find that your molds have burst and crack on one side more than the other.

Therefore reheat your molds, not applying fire, except to cover it.

And because your lead and tin become brittle when melting the over high heat, in order to make them less brittle, heat them over low heat, and cast in stick form.

 

Brick cools the metal, and if this is not for binding, it is not necessary.
