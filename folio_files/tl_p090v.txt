and will be good and will mold cleanly. Because the sand is coarse and dry, filter it through a sieve. If it is not fine enough, wash it. And when the water has settled a little, pour the soiled water into another pot. The coarse [grains] will quickly fall to the bottom of the first pot. But the sand from the troubled water pot, having settled, will be much finer. If this sand does not bind enough, dry crush it on the porphyry, thus making it impalpable, and it will bind as chalk does.  If you wish you can reheat it, and straight after crush it and blend it with salts, or burned cloth, or felt, or paper ashes, or similar material.

Grind it in a mortar mustard mill with water, and it will become as impalpable as possible. Dry it, then moisten it with salt water, which give force to  all sands in order to allow several castings.

 

p090v_a2Orange trees

In Italy, particularly in the coldest areas like Lombardia, people plant the orange trees inside squared wood planters. The planters are larger at the bottom than at the top. People make handles on each side, where they attach straps in order to carry the planter, like one carries the gout sufferers, because if one used wheels to roll them one would damage the garden's paths. Every two year they remember to open the sides of the planters and meticulously cut and trim the ends of the orange tree's roots, which are dry. Otherwise, the roots find the wood [of the planter] and tighten on it, they double over themselves, the ends dry and the tree dies. Once trimmed, the roots gain new space  to expand, without encountering resistance from the wood of the planter. That is why it is better to join the sides of the planter with screws rather than nails, to avoid shaking the soil when one opens them.
