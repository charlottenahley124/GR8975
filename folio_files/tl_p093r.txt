p093r_a1Olives

The olives go bad if you do not refresh their salt water once a month, do not touch it with your hands, otherwise they will go bad.

p093r_a2Country folk's observation

When it freezes on Palm Sunday, it will freeze every month of the year

When the first flowers fall because of the frost, the other flowers also start perish. 

p093r_a3Grafts

Do not use a graft from old wood, because it never makes a beautiful tree.

Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.

Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.

All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.

p093r_a4Sand

The white ash of all kinds of wood, which still sticks to the wood while burning, and which has not fallen into the hearth, molds very clean

 

p093r_a5Sand

Very fine pulverized soot molds and removes easily from the mold.  The best soot, which is greasy and shiny, is the one from the big kitchens

Very fine pulverized quicklime works, but mixed flint, crumbled into the hollow, does better.
