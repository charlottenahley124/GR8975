Painter

Scribes make darker shades of lake and other colors for clothing with egg yolk, but this is a fraud and does not last.

Others glaze rouges de mine and other [colors] that are not beautiful in oil using egg white so that they seem to be done in oil. But humidity damages all that.

Brushes

 

Take some that have been used a little by white-limers, because the harshness of the quick-lime and usage make them easier to handle.

Painting on glass

For blue, they take some of the roughest azure d'email and grind it on shale, and mix in two or three rosary beads' worth of lead rock or more, according to the quantity of work. And having done their drawing with noir d'escaille (which is painted towards the light with the piece of glass upright), they lay all their pieces down over white paper so that by the whiteness of the paper they can judge the lighting of their scenes and put down all colors of the same kind at the same time. Then they reheat.
