But if you find it too thick, add more <material>oil</material>, whereas if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little <material>turpentine</material>. And so you will give it whatever consistency you want. It could be made without <tool>fire</tool>, but it is more desiccative when heated. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things, without distorting the colors or yellowing, and dries both in the shade and under the sun, overnight, and during the summer as well as in the winter. It is usually sold 15 sols a <unit>pound</unit>.</block>
<block position="left-bottom">You need a little more <material>turpentine</material> than <material>turpentine oil</material> to thicken the <material>varnish</material>, which you need to apply with your finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick because when it is thick, it turns yellow and gathers [together]. <material>Varnish</material> is not used to make paintings shine, because it just takes the light out of them.</block>

        <purpose type="making"/> This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters. Some take
        the most delicate they can &amp; crush it with <material>ceruse</material>, which binds it,
        and next prick with an <tool>awl</tool> in several places the area they want to paint with
                <material><foreign language="french">azur d’esmail</foreign></material>, such that
        the <material>oil</material> enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; does not cause the
            <material>azure</material>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat
        &amp; apply the <material>azure</material> on it, which is also done <foreign
            language="french">à destrempe</foreign>. The main thing is to crush it well on
                <tool><material>marble</material></tool>, and before that, to have washed it
        thoroughly. Some grind it with thoroughly with an <material>egg yolk</material> &amp; then
        wash it in five or six lots of <material>water</material> and lay it on not with a
                <tool><foreign language="french">painceau</foreign></tool>, which would be too soft,
        but with a <tool><foreign language="french">broisse</foreign></tool> highly softened &amp;
        bent, &amp; laying it on thickly as if one were applying it with a <tool>trowel</tool>;
        settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that crushing <material><foreign
                language="french">azur d’esmail</foreign></material> with <material>egg
            yolk</material> &amp; then washing it in several lots of <material>water</material> is
        good, although it loses a little of its vividness in the crushing of it. I have also washed
        it in several lots of <material>water</material> &amp;, when it had settled a little, I
        removed the <material>water</material>, still q blue, with a <tool>sponge</tool> and
        squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, &amp; from the residue I had the
            <material>ash</material>, <material><plant>flower</plant></material> and subtlest part
        of the <material>azure</material> without crushing it, which is the best, for in the
        crushing of it, it loses some of its color. Those who make it in <place>Germany</place>
        compose it like <material>enamel</material>, in large pieces which they <tool>pestle</tool>,

        happens to be sandy, do not crush it except with the <material>egg yolk</material> or,

        &amp; with a sponge remove the <material_format>colored

    <heading>To <color>white</color>n <material>enilanroc</material></heading>

    <block>Some believe the ceruse-color crust that is on top to be natural. Others say that it is a
        lost secret of ancient <profession>lapidaries</profession>. Others say that it is
            <material>enamel</material> that has been reheated. And, from this crust, one can form
        multiple ciphers, letters, circles and other bizarre motifs. As to the means, I proceeded
        thus: I once wanted to add a layer of <material>arsenic</material> ground on
            <material>marble</material>. However, I did the experiment without it, and I put the
        above mentioned thing, <material>enilanroc</material>, in a <tool>small
                <material>iron</material> casket</tool> on the <tool>fire</tool> of my
                <tool><profession>goldsmith</profession>'s forge</tool> with three or four
            <material_format>small half-burnt <material>coal</material>s</material_format> and blew
        on it only with my <tool>mouth</tool>. However, the thing caught fire and became all <color>white</color>,
        not only on its surface but also inside. And then I let it cool on its own near the <tool>fire</tool>,
        since otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have cracked. While it was all
        <color>white</color>, I passed it through my <tool><material>lead</material> wheel</tool> and I found it to be as hard as it was before. And
        after scraping off a little of the <color>white</color>, I found it to be of <color>a clear fleshy tone</color>. Finally,
        I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could
        compare with a quite beautiful <material>agate</material> for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful
        face and applying it to a table of</block>

    <block> <material>agate</material> of various colors. But because this overall <color>white</color>ness did not correspond with the
        <color>white</color> crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing its <color>natural
            color</color>, I made a hole in a <tool><material>brick</material></tool>, precisely the same size as the object, and put it inside.
        Then I heated two <tool><profession>glassmaker</profession>'s soldering iron</tool>s until they became <color>red</color> hot and, when they were
        <color>red</color> hot, I applied them one after the other onto the surface of the object until I got the
        <color>white</color> crust I was looking for, on which I made the drawing that I wanted, revealing the <color>red</color>
        background, with a <tool>diamond point</tool>, and I polished it with <tool>hog bristles</tool> and <tool><material>tripoli</material></tool>. I don't
            know if it would be better to reheat it under <tool><material_format>hot <material>ashes</material></material_format></tool>, and if it would be good to encase
            it in <tool><material>alabaster</material></tool>, which is quite cold, as I did in the <tool><material>brick</material></tool>.

    <heading>For <material_format><material>earth</material> walls</material_format> and rustic
        construction</heading>

    <block><animal>Swallows</animal> have taught us this craft by building their nests out of
            <material>mud</material> mingled with wisps and bits of
            <material><plant>hay</plant></material> or <material><plant>straw</plant></material> to
        make it bond. Therefore, in places where <material>stones</material> and
            <material>bricks</material> are lacking, one can use <material>earth</material> to make
        walls thin and thick. The best for this is <material_format>light
            <material>earth</material></material_format>, which does not form clumps when plowed, or
        better, that which in some way mingled with <material>arene</material>, because it can be
        most easily beaten and tamped down. It is true that it needs to be dampened and cut into
        clumps with a <tool>ditch-spade</tool>, and put and placed in this <tool>form</tool>. This
        one lasts more and does not require that much effort, and dryness doesn't make it split or
        crack. However, since such kinds of <material>earth</material> are not found everywhere,
        those who live on good and fertile land, after drawing the width and length of their
        foundations with a <tool>rope</tool>, drive in <tool>long poles and rafters</tool> along the
        edges on each side to support <tool>boards</tool> between which they throw the
            <material>earth</material>, making each layer about <unit>one foot</unit> thick,
        interspersed with <material_format>S.S.S-shaped branches of
                <material><plant>heather</plant></material></material_format> or similar things,
        then they tamp it down and beat it with <tool>beaters of three different forms</tool>. One
        is called the <tool>mall</tool>, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used
        firstly to tamp down the <material>earth</material>. Then one uses another made of
            <tool>pointed <material>woodblocks</material> fitted onto a thick stick</tool>, and this
        one is used to properly press the <material>earth</material> at the wall’s ends and edges
        where they adhere to the <tool>boards</tool>, and is called [blank]. The other one is called
        the <tool>bat</tool> and is used to flatten and beat the <material>earth</material> for the
        last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of <material>earth</material> and
                <material><plant>heather</plant></material> and beats as has been said, and
        continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with
                <material><plant>heather</plant></material> and then with
        <material>earth</material>. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of
            <material>bricks</material>. They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to
        the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it
            <color>white</color>ns, showing that it has <material>saltpeter</material> in it. Which
        is why, when they fall down, <profession>gunpowder</profession> makers profit from
        them.</block>

    <heading>Damask Cloth</heading>

    <block>You can make damask cloth of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding
        anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is dyed <color>yellow</color>, pounce onto it
        such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some <tool>string or a bigger
            cord</tool> loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a dye of
            <material>woad</material> or <material>pastel</material> and it will become
            <color>green</color>, except that which is beneath the <tool>string</tool>, which will
        remain <color>yellow</color> because the <color>green</color> dye will not have penetrated
        there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of <tool>string or
            cord</tool>, add some <tool>pieces of poor quality cloth cut in <name type="group"
                >Moorish</name> shapes</tool> on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will
        have cheap embroidery.</block>

    <heading>Casting <material>metal</material>s</heading>

    <block>Candlesticks and small works are cast in a <tool>frame</tool> with
            <material>sand</material>. Having stamped the work, sprinkle it with
            <material>flour</material> in order to make the <material>copper</material> or
            <material>latten</material> run better. When the <material>sand</material> has been in
        use for one month, it is necessary to take some new <material>sand</material> because that
        which has been used, being reheated +, dries &amp; loses its binding power. Yet it is used
        mixed with the new <material>sand</material>, because it makes the work less porous. Large
        works such as artillery, bells and similar things are cast in <material>earth</material>,
        and <material>copper</material> cast in <material>earth</material> makes less crust and is
            <color>white</color>r than when cast in <material>sand</material>. The
            <material>earth</material> is <material_format>sandy
            <material>clay</material></material_format> mixed with <material><animal>horse</animal>
            dung</material> and <material_format><material>cloth</material> waste</material_format>.
        The <material>earth</material> that has been used for casting, which is
        <color>black</color>, baked and as if burnt, is mixed with <material_format>artificial
                <material>sand</material></material_format>, and is very good. For softening and
        making the <material>copper</material> run, once it is melted, one throws in some
            <material>lead</material>, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of
        the cast.</block>

    <block>The <material>sand</material> must be made from something very dry and arid and reheated

            <material>silver</material> would leap out of the <tool>mold</tool> and sustain damage.
        It is also necessary for the <material>earth</material> to absorb the
            <material>metal</material> because <material_format>cast
            <material>gold</material></material_format> or <material_format>cast
                <material>silver</material></material_format> becomes very porous. That is why it

    <heading>Tracing a history on glass</heading>

    <block>If you want to trace a history in intaglio on <material>glass</material>, you can do so
        in different ways. Place your glass pane on, as thin as possible, over the printed history,
        &amp; having cleaned the glass well with <material>lye</material> &amp;
            <material>ashes</material> so that it is not at all greasy, trace over the lines visible
        to you with oily black or scales black with a <tool>pinceau</tool>, if you want to paint
        with colors in the manner of glaziers, who spread a wash of scales black all over their
        glass pane &amp; then scratch &amp; uncover what they want to coat with color, leaving that
        which is necessary for shading. But if you want to make gilt histories on glass with a
        background of colors, which imitates the basse-taille of goldsmiths, gild the whole glass
        pane with <material>gum water</material> or <material>garlic juice</material> or
            <material>fig-tree milk</material>. Then moisten your printed history with two wet
            <tool>linen cloths</tool> &amp; lay it down on the gilt glass. Then with a
            <tool>pin</tool> mounted on a small <tool>stick</tool>, follow the lines of your history

        very fat, you have to add more sand and more manure. But one does find fat varieties of

    <heading>Colors and gilt on glass</heading>
    <block>You should not put as strong <material>gummed water</material> on
            <material>glass</material> for the silver layer as for the gold layer because a
            <material>silver leaf</material> is twice as strong as <material>gold leaf</material>.
        Also, silver is harder and therefore does not scratch as easily. And if
            <material>gum</material> was not a little [too] strong for silver, it would not crack so
        clearly. When you work, the exhalation of your breath humidifies the leaf lying on the
        glass, and therefore it would be good, when working, to heat it up a few times. You have to
        very thoroughly wash what you want to be empty and used as a surface painted with colors,
        because if it is not really clean of the gum's grease and viscosity, and of other things,
        the colors will not be so clear on it. To advance your work you can smooth with a
            <tool>pumice stone</tool>, or [you can do this] to better lay down gum and leaf on a cut
            <tool>paper</tool>. This way, you will have to do very little repairs. If you want a
        gold color there without gold, mix soaked dried <material>saffron</material> with a little

    <block>For large wax seals, you should always have tepid <material>water</material> handy, and
        keep your <material>wax</material> in it. Yet previously you should have kneaded it with
        your hands, so as to make it very smooth and even, for otherwise the water would penetrate
        the wax and prevent it from holding together. Afterwards, you can imprint whatever you want.
        Cover the wax in three or four sheets of <material>paper</material>, and, with a round and
        smooth <tool>stick</tool> similar to a <tool>pestle</tool>, roll it out as if to polish it.
        It will then stick to the paper, helping you to take it off from the seal. In this way you
        will imprint better than if you were dripping molten wax. You can carve figures and color
        them in gold, in silver, or paint them with <material>couleurs à vernis</material>, and
        transfer them onto a <material>glass pane</material> painted with <material>couleurs à

    <block>To shoot your <tool>arquebus</tool> precisely the end of the breech must come precisely
        on the edge of the light, because like this the <material>powder</material> catches [fire]
        and burns all at once without blowing and has more strength and does not recoil. On the
        contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the powder catches more
        quickly in this place, makes it recoil, and blows. This is clearly shown [by] a arquebus
        with a chamber which recoils more than another. And since the cannon is bigger at the breech
        than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, because that at the breech is higher than
        that at the muzzle. Additionally, the thickness of the cannon is greater than the caliber by
        about one line, and the sight by another. It would therefore be necessary to either make the
        cannon all of one size or to raise the barrel from the end and towards the muzzle, and push
        it in and lower towards the breech. The weight of the powder must be one third of the
        [weight of the] <tool>bullet</tool>.</block>

    <block>It is necessary to make a <tool>wooden pipe</tool> 4 or 5 fingers wide that is perfectly
        hollow, according to the open end of your barrel, of the form represented in A. Then, having
        cut some <material>paper</material>, which has to be as strong as that of large printed
        books, in the form indicated in D and as wide as you want your cartridge to be long, wrap
        the paper around the <tool>baton</tool> B and at the top, where the pointed tip F will be
        around the aforementioned paper, and the cartridge will be formed. But, in order to make the
        bottom more uniform, put it into <tool>pipe</tool> A, then introduce baton B and, in the
        other end of the pipe, which is marked G, insert baton C and pack so as to compact and press
        the folded tip of your cartridge, then take it out, and the charge in this, put three or
        four drageons or <material>larmes</material>. Then, with a <tool>punch</tool>, marked E, of
        the same caliber of your arquebus or pistol, punch round pieces on cardboard or felt or
        waxed cloth, and put this round piece into your cartridge, and push it until the drageons
        with the baton B, the more drageons, 3 or 4, then a round piece. And continue like that
        until the cartridge is full, the put it into the <tool>arquebus</tool>. If you want your
        pellet to scatter earlier, make round pieces out of paper. If you want it to reach further
        without scattering, make the piece out of <material>cardboard</material>. If you want it to
        reach even further, make the round piece out of <material>waxed cloth</material>, or either
        of <material>leather</material> or <material>felt</material>, and a piece of waxed cloth on
        the top. And if you make the cartridge in part with waxed cloth or <material>waxed
            paper</material>, it will reach one hundred paces and will make a big hole, and the
        pellet, barely scattering, will produce a big opening. But if you make your cartridge with
        waxed cloth or a material stronger than paper, it cannot be so long, with the cardboard tip
        being like in D, because it is enough if it wrapped around twice. In such a way, the pellet
        barely scatters and makes a big hole in porte-corps armor or others.</block>

<block purpose="making">One must choose the finest possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work in oil. And if you cannot find any that is fine enough, you may as well grind it, not with <material>water</material> but with <material>oil</material>, and grind it thick. Then lay it on your palette and mix in some <material>turpentine</material> but not much, to make it bind, and make it as thick as butter or mortar, and then, with a large enough <tool>brush</tool>, work it while always moving the brush freely. Then, to soften it, make jagged hatching movements with the tip of the brush. The highlights will be made using the same diluted with <material>ceruse</material>, which makes it bind, making it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, so that you almost need an effort to spread it with your <tool>brush</tool>. And it will be all the better if you lay down your painting. All these difficulties do not occur when it is very fine and fluid without being crushed, and it doesn't run.

<block>Painting perspectives in oil takes a long time because of the many lines that need to be drawn with a <tool>ruler</tool>, and for that reason one generally paints them in <material>distemper</material>. One chooses the vanishing points at will. The main thing is to know where the point is. One commonly sets two or three, sometimes up to five.

<heading>Drawing</heading>

<block purpose="painting">After you have primed your panel and scraped it with a <tool>knife</tool> to make it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest possible piece of <material>charcoal</material>, because with a short one you would not see your line so well and you would make it rougher. Let the tip of the <material>charcoal</material> be sharp, and to prevent if from quickly becoming dulled and blunt, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly sharpen it. Hold your <material>charcoal</material> as far as possible, and accustom yourself to drawing with a light touch. Because if you become accustomed to drawing delicately with charcoal, you shall do the same with colors. And whoever is rough with charcoal is never exquisite with colors. And by a line of charcoal, masters assess their apprentices. First make the contour of your drawing, that is the outline, lightly and without too diligent work, rather with boldness. By so doing, you will learn to be an artist, and if you need to erase anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it. Afterwards work on all the details, not standing too close to your panel, but sometimes stepping back in order to better assess the proportions. Once you are satisfied with the first drawing, retrace all the lines with your <tool>paintbrush</tool> in <color>pink</color> or another gummed or distempered color. Thus you will work more surely with colors, and with less trouble.

<heading>Perspective</heading>

<block>In order to tell where the vanishing point is one must lay a <tool>ruler</tool> over the lines, and the point will be where the lines meet. Some make a hole at the end of their <tool>rulers</tool> in order to fix the point by that hole while moving the <tool>ruler</tool> about.

The <tool>ruler</tool> and <tool>compass</tool> without discernment of the eye will cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

<heading>Founders of small <material>tin</material> work</heading>

<block>
  They usually cast from soft <material>solder</material> the things that should not become hollow, because hollow works require fine and <material>soft tin</material>. However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they are mixed or include <material>glass tin</material>  in them, just like they mix a little <sup><material>glass tin</material></sup> in the <material>soft tin</material>. They carve their work on <material>stones</material> of which the sharpening stones or barber's files are made. These are found in great flakes near the <place>mountains</place>, and resemble <material>slate</material>. They are found in three colors: one reddish, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain heat ; <sup>another</sup> one  is the color of dark <material>slate</material>, and the other is whitish. When they work a relief, first they print it on <material>carton</material>, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their <material>stones</material> and rubbing them together , they use a <tool>compass</tool> or <tool>little iron tools</tool> to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four <material>stones</material>, to make a circle or a square with the <material>stones</material> which join perfectly because the <material>stones</material> are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with <material>tallow</material>, and it <sup>the mould</sup> absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having <sup>put</sup> fine powder of <material>quicklime</material> into a <tool>cloth</tool>, they rub the mould using pounce in beating the <material>linen</material> on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles <sup>from forming</sup>. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown <sup>on the picture</sup>. They make a hole in the <m>medal</m>, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the <material>medal</material>.

        After they have been dryly ground and beaten in the mortar, they are ground finely on the marble. I mixed the same quantity of each material, and in order to mix them better, I ground them on the porphyry again, and then filtered this through a double sieve or the sleeve of a shirt. Then, I put them on sheets of paper and stored it on marble in a cellar. In one night, they were both moist enough [that there there was no need] to dampen them further because rock salt, like all other salts, dissolves in dampness. I molded with this very neatly because both should be quite fine. They need to be moist enough so it can be removed easily.

    <heading>Mineral sand</heading>
    
    <block>
        It does not matter if the sand color is white or yellow. Above all it the sand must be lumped together much like a precious stone or a stone, and the deeper in the earth one gets it from, the better. The signs of its quality is that it is thus gathered together, that, if the stone is removed as it should be i.e. in the correct way, it forms pieces and  lumps together, which demonstrates its capacity for binding, and that it the sand is not too dry.
        
        However, it should crumble in your hands. And the grain must be  quite small, fine, and homogeneous. If this sand is not fine enough, you can filter it and grind it up finely either with water, or through a sieve, when it or on the porphyry. That way it loses its dryness and becomes greasy and well bound. You can mold it in  a box mold or in a noyau without wadding, and try it with lead because, if it does not swell and casts neatly, it will bear out well too. Some say that fatty sands do not work for casting metal that is too hot. Artisans who undertake a big job and who want to save money do not need to crush sand and seek the curious properties of artificial sand; they have more to profit from finding natural sand that has the finest grain possible. And for a small job, they take advantage of finding the finest natural sand they can. For a smaller job, they only filter the sand through the sieve. But those who work on a very small scale crush the sand and grind it finely until it becomes impalpable, because they do not need as much sand.

        I pulverised them separately and ground them finely on the porphyry as much as I could. Then I mixed all of one with the other and re-ground it on the porphyry. Afterwards I moistened it in paper folded in a moist napkin which is made wet more quickly from the moisture of the night, or the moisture of the cellar. I have never found one which can be removed more cleanly from the mold than this, though it needs to be quite moist. And if you want to cast small works, make it very hot. It came out very cleanly from the doulx tin, like the main one, and has sustained several castings. For tin, I believe that it is not necessary to look further to find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use with fine lead which has almost better results than tinTou. The bone of an ox hoof is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty sand, so it will bind like tripoli, salts, felt, ashes and similar materials. If you do not mix ox-hoof bone, it will not turn out from the mold and will not mold cleanly because it crumbles.

    <heading>Ammonia salt and alabaster</heading>
    
    <block>
        Dry ammonia salt, ground  on a marble slab, molds very cleanly and is easily removed from the mold. When mixed with pulverized alabaster, use two ounces per pound of alabaster; it also is easily removed from the mold. It should be humidified in a cellar or in the cool humid evening air, or to have it quickly, in a sheet of paper in a moist towel. Take care not to leave it too long because it will soften, which would not be good if you wanted to use it as a box mold. However you can use it well as a core provided that you dry it gently and away from the fire. Otherwise the heat would make it swell, and push the salt onto the surface, causing lumps. If you want to mold a core,  rub your medal with aspic oil. It is better to use 4 ounces of ammonia salt per pound. Humidify it in a damp place for two or three days, so that the material can be handled without sticking. You will mold very cleanly. Let the mold dry out and reheat it, that way it will get body, and become as hard as stone and when it is like that it is far easier to remove from the mold. If you do not reheat it, it could crumble when removed from the mold because of its thinness. It is the same with a large relief medal. Once you have molded, pulverize the material like before, and moisten it in a damp atmosphere.
        
        
        
        left-middleAll sands which can be removed easily from the mold have body, well-made fat ammonia, and  is sand that removes easily from a mold. There is nothing better for binding than the salt of the metal itself. When ground into powder, they pick up moisture, dry and reheat together.

    <heading>White glassmaker's sand mixed with ammonia salt</heading>
    
    <block>
        You can find this sand in Cominge, near the town Aurignac. This sand is dry and as white  as salt. Glassmakers and potters use this sand ground on the porphyry until it becomes as fine as possible. Easy to grind, this sand looks like calcined alabaster, and provides a very clean mold. I have not found another as suitable for delicate bas reliefs. It is also excellent to mold as a core, without any box mold. You must grind it very finely on a porphyry with gummed water or pure water, then apply a thick coat (as thick as mustard or a little bit thicker) over the medal, which has already been lightly rubbed with oil, walnut oil or, even better, aspic oil. For best results, let it dry by itself, away from fire, for one or two days. If you are in a hurry, you can heat it; it should not break if the coat is quite thick. If it is suddenly exposed to fire, some holes will appear; that does not happen if it has been gently dried. Once dry, reheat it, and it should allow for several castings.

        I pulverized sal ammoniac, previously well dried in a hot bronze mortar over heat. Then I filtered the salt through a double sieve; it became very fine. But to make it finer, I dry ground it  on the porphyry, then I mixed it with iron dross which was pulverized and ground the same way. Both ingredients take a very clean cast of bas-reliefs, without being moistened with serain, or into the hollow mould, or anywhere else with the serviette, and the cast can be cleanly removed.

    <heading>Every kind of sand can be made useful</heading>
    
    <block>
        Artisans who do big works, and who need to search for things made by nature to pursue their work, because nature does not want to sell its wares to its children, and in order to save the time they would spend grinding, pulverizing and artificially preparing their sand, look for sand from sandpits, which is not too fat from the soil, nor too arid and, consequently, without any binder effect. From deep in the sandpit, one can find some lumps and gravel that show the sand's natural compaction; it is quite hard to break, with very small and fine grains, quite smooth between the fingers. And since it is found solely close to mountainous regions or arid lands, you cannot find any near every good town, where artisans live. Thus, if they can't find any close to their home, they prefer to order some of this sand from afar, like Lyon, Venice or Paris, near the Sainte Chapelle, and similar areas, instead of preparing it themselves. Nonetheless, you can be assured that in all locations, you can make sand from the sandpit
        and will be good and will mold cleanly. Because the sand is coarse and dry, filter it through a sieve. If it is not fine enough, wash it. And when the water has settled a little, pour the soiled water into another pot. The coarse [grains] will quickly fall to the bottom of the first pot. But the sand from the troubled water pot, having settled, will be much finer. If this sand does not bind enough, dry crush it on the porphyry, thus making it impalpable, and it will bind as chalk does.  If you wish you can reheat it, and straight after crush it and blend it with salts, or burned cloth, or felt, or paper ashes, or similar material.

    <heading>Orange trees</heading>
    
    <block>
        In Italy, particularly in the coldest areas like Lombardia, people plant the orange trees inside squared wood planters. The planters are larger at the bottom than at the top. People make handles on each side, where they attach straps in order to carry the planter, like one carries the gout sufferers, because if one used wheels to roll them one would damage the garden's paths. Every two year they remember to open the sides of the planters and meticulously cut and trim the ends of the orange tree's roots, which are dry. Otherwise, the roots find the wood [of the planter] and tighten on it, they double over themselves, the ends dry and the tree dies. Once trimmed, the roots gain new space  to expand, without encountering resistance from the wood of the planter. That is why it is better to join the sides of the planter with screws rather than nails, to avoid shaking the soil when one opens them.

        Any tree that has a large pith will be hard to be graft from, because the cutting is difficult to remove.  If the pith is damaged, the graft will take in an unstraight manner, like with vines of all peach and apricot trees.
        
        
        
        Apricot trees have a very thin bark, and so it is necessary to graft them onto young trees whose own bark is not thick yet, such as the young shoots of prune trees or apricot trees.
        
        
        
        The graft will not take if the cutting gets wet.  It is necessary therefore to graft in serein and mild weather, not too cold and not too windy.
        
        
        
        One must use old wood to graft, if one wants to graft on a tree that is already mature and quite big; because if this is the case, it will compress the cutting, and if the cutting is of young wood, it will not grow properly. But old wood resists the compression of old wood better than the young, because it is harder than young wood. But if the graft is done with only old wood, it will never grow beautifully, but will be frail and short and will take a long time to grow.

    <heading>Molding with cuttlefish bone</heading>
    <block> Pay attention to keep the bones in a dry place, because they are very prone to dampness.
        If you have a small medal, divide the bone into two pieces, then smooth the two parts with a
        knife. And on a dry, smooth rooftile [that has been] pulverized with willow charcoal, rub
        and polish the two half bones. In this way, the bones soak up the willow charcoal so that
        the bones will come off cleanly from the cast, and will not stick to it. Then on a fake
        bone, that is to say a bit of smooth brick of the same width as your bone, place your medal.
        And then on the medal, put your bone and press it firmly with another stone of the same
        size. And for a second time, mold it, and instead smooth over the top with willow charcoal
        and blow slowly, then press as before, and it will cast neatly. If it is for a spoon handle,
        two whole bones are needed. Any work that is cast is brittle and prone to breaking, because
        the metal swells when cast, and contracts and condenses when hammered. That is why it is
        necessary to retrace with a chisel the cast object and in this way the metal will contract
        again and let it escrouir. If the piece you have to cast is in high relief, first trace the
        mold and the hollow with a penknife, to make a clear path for the medal and then cast it.
        And if the medal has two sides </block>
    <block position="left-bottom">Rather than casting, heat the bones only to make them lose the
        coldness and wetness.</block>

    <block> Because the two bones are joined, cut around them with precision, and make notches in
        different places which cross through where the two bones are joined, so as to recognize the
        place where they were first joined. Or with little shards of wood, you can also pierce the
        bones, or coat the joints with clay, and leave it to dry. Compress between them it with your
        two hands in between your knees; and do not use a normal press, otherwise the bones will
        break. Mold at your leisure two or three times, until you can see that it has the design
        come up and is well imprinted. And on each occasion rather than putting the piece straight
        back in the mold, smooth with willow charcoal because it helps it to come out easily. Once
        you have cast, rub your medal with oil and willow charcoal with a brush, to make it dull.
        Take care that your medal is not greasy or oily when you cast it in cuttlefish bone. Once
        you have cast, leave it to cool rather than taking the medal out straight away, because when
        one takes it out hot, some bone will come away with the medal. Cast at medium heat, which
        you will recognize because the bone should stay almost white. But when it is too hot, the
        bone becomes brown. The proportion of lead and tin is equal, one to the other. If the piece
        is difficult to cast, and composed of various pieces, cast it with a forked pattern, of
        three or four grooves, and make and make these grooves where the metal is the thickest. Also
        make these grooves around the medal and directly on the head because this attracts the metal
        and will fill the figure best. Lift your boxmold a little, once you cast, and in this way
        you will be able to make several clean casts. Tin that is too hot burns the bone which
        becomes damaged. Moreover, having come out of the mold hot , it risks breaking. <figure

       And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine tin, which is harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it.  And one leaves it in one half of the box mold, &amp; presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you shall cast in your box mold the solder described above, or another more meltable than fine tin. And thus, the second medal will melt and mold itself on the first one without ruining it. But to be safer, temper lamp black with water, &amp; with a pinceau, give a light coat of this to the medal, which remains in the box mold, &amp; leave to dry. Thus it will not melt.
        
        But if you have a  medal of copper or silver, you can leave it in the casting, if you want to cast with lead or tin; but it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold would make the tin contract.

        Or melt 4 â„¥ of tin, and when it  has cooled, purify it by removing the filth on the top, then make a hole and inside there add  i â„¥ of â˜¿ and if you remelt it, it will be like tin but it will be fragile. If you want to know if it is tin or â˜¿, redden a shovel and put a small piece of your ingot on the top. If it is tin, the piece will melt but remain, but if it is â˜¿, it will melt immediately then, crackling quite hard, it will evaporate. It must be frozen in a ladle or in a hollow crucible, and make the hole medium sized.
        
        It can also be frozen, as I tried, that is to say with aqua fortis which before corroded a bit of silver. This, mixed, will make tin and lead fluid.

        Pure tin, frozen mercury, smells like tin. Iced tin, pure lead, as much of one as of the other, makes a substance that  melts very quickly but that is fragile and white. I think that it would be good for soldering. [Takes a] long time to cool.

        Do not use a graft from old wood, because it never makes a beautiful tree.
        
        Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.
        
        Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.
        
        All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.

    <heading>Faces painted with distemper</heading>

    <block>

        Because colors painted with distemper dry quickly and one would not have enough time to complete the shadows and touches on the face, one wets the reverse of the face, on canvas, with a wet sponge. Then, with a small pinceau, one makes the shadows, which won't come off. Next, one lays the flesh tones, which do not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And then, one retouches the more prominent areas with lively flesh tones. And with another pinceau one retouches the shadows in hatching. The shadow strokes do not come off because they are made of bister, which stains the canvas like rust. The said bister is good for making shadows with distemper, for in oil it has no body and would dry with great difficulty. One mixes ru ochre in the said bister for shadows with a little sap green. The best bister is the rich, shiny one from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is difficult to grind and screeches on the marble slab.

       Azur desmail always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the used water would makes it die. It always needs to be coated twice, &amp; first very thickly, driving the pinceau by laying it lengthwise then across. It is better used on canvas, which imbibes it immediately, than on wood. Varnish restores its vigor, because while imbibing, it becomes dark. To try it, painters bring their palettes to the grocers and distemper and mix @ it with a bit of white crushed in oil, for in this way the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, while the mediocre is lavender grey. The thinner one is best to work with. It is made thinner by being washed.

    <heading>Burnisher</heading>
    
    <block>
        The different parts of a sword are the handle, [and] the sheath of the sword. What comes next is the heel. The rest is the blade. The sides are the edge and the point. Certain blades, acute in point, have only one side filed in the middle &amp; along the whole length, and are easy to break. Other blades are called of three molds or three grips, which have one good rise in the middle, but this elevation is flat as if it were acute in point but flattened. These ones are most certain. Others are called fluted, which are notched from the middle, &amp; when it is along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those acute in point and are more troublesome to burnish because the burnishing stick can't get in. But they make one specially that is narrow.
        
        Making up the hilt of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the hilt and the cross-guard, which is this iron strip that closes off the guard [and] that is at the end of the heel to stop thrusts from sliding down the hilt. The rings are these two branches in half round that start from the eye of the guard and go all the way to the branch of the cross-guard.  The branch that crosses the hilt is called the body and this escutcheon, by which the sword enters the sheath and to which all the branches return, and which holds them, is called the eye of the guard.
        
        
        
        Following is the wood of the grip which one glues or more fittingly [uses] some mingled wax which is made of wax and pitch, for rosin would be too hard. He heats it lightly, then rubs the wood of the grip so that the tang takes hold, or the threads, otherwise, when a thread frays off, the whole thing will break all at once. With iron thread or dog skin, one also uses glue. The trimming set on the wood, which is made of silk or thread, is called the cord, which is made from two or three threads twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if the silk is thin. A cord a little bigger holds better. The rivements, which are also made of silk at both ends of the grip, are called the buttons.
        
        
        
        Some grips are made of silk, seal skin, iron thread reheated with gold and fine and false silver thread &amp; velvet [thread]. Iron thread is of less price and is most durable. Next is that of silk, if one does not have the convenience of being close to the sea in order to recover some dog skin, which is quite convenient. The good skin costs fifty or lx s{ous} and makes 4 or five dozen grips. This one gives a good grip and a sure hand. To put it to work, if it is too hard, soak it for one or two hours in slightly lukewarm aqua fortis. Because if it were too hot, it would boil and spoil the skin. It is sewn with black thread.

        The gold handles are made with some yellow thin cloth set below or other kind of chalk-yellowed fabric. And this cloth is set on with glue or aforesaid gum. This is in order to make the thread hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the silk ones and between two cordons are put one or two threads to enhance it. The silver one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the silk one, not because silk is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine gold handle is worth 28 or 20 cents.
        
        The best sword point is of sage foliage.
        
        
        
        This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in order to furbish is called the chameau. It is commonly made from rowan which is hard and even.
        
        The stick underneath which is folded bow-like is called the arch.
        
        The stick above is called stick of the fustÃ©e.
        
        And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called the fustÃ©e.
        
        There are two horns, one is called the oil hornet and the other the emery hornet. 
        
        There is an iron tool with the shape of a halberd point, square and made of very even and well limed steel called the grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with stone or other tools which leave some scratches.
        
        To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also sharpened.
        
        Those who create sword hilts are different craftsmen than furbishers.
        
        The fustÃ©e is a three-finger-thick, square wood tool, made of boxwood which fit in the middle of the fustÃ©e stick to furbish.
        
        The fresil stick is made of willow wood which is to [â€¦] weapon with some clinker which is the iron scale falling from the blacksmiths' forge.

        The furbisher buys his blades by the dozen which are not finished, [but ready] to be pulled from [their] sheaths since he does this himself in order to add them well at the pommels and guards.
        
        
        
        Spanish swords are esteemed to be better for they are of better steel and iron but they are not as well-forged as Vienna swords, in DauphinÃ©. The Spanish ones are not as well sharpened from the forge since they sharpen them with their feet and this is what makes them wavy.
        
        
        
        Vienna blades cost commonly Xviii or 19 lb.
        
        
        
        The first thing the furbisher does to his new blades is to draw them out from the sheath, which he does himself or has it done by locksmiths or blacksmiths to whom he gives some liart for their charcoal. Afterwards they pass it over a grindstone to cut it down. Then they lay it down on the chameau, and with some powdered emery, fine and soft as flour, and soaked with oil to make it take, they polish the sword with the stick used to take off the tracks left by the grindstone and then they clean the blade well with the emery. And they add a drop or two of oil spread with the finger to give it luster. Once the oil is applied, they polish it again on the chameau with the "felin" which is a thunderstone mounted on the middle of a stick like the "fustÃ©e." And this stick is called the "felindel" stick. Once they used the "felin," they polish it again with some chalk and the oil [already] on the sword. After they follow this and going over it again, they polish it with dry chalk. Finally when they are finished with mounting [of the pommel and guard], they give it a sharp edge with a file. They then dry it and sharpen it and furbish it again with some dry chalk. At the end when they are completed and mounted, they give it [the blade] a sharp edge with a grater.
        
        
        
        They are polished on a false mounting with the guards which are present in order to find out if they work well together. And employing a blade of the sort of which all the sizes should be made in the hand, one conjectures whether it will be as strong when mounted.
        
        
        
        One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of wood, then with a file, they enlarge [it] if needed for attaching the guard. Then to clench it, one positions the place to be riveted and the pommel on a piece of wood. And with a hammer, one beats on the top to make it very level and to secure the pommel. Then with the hammer, one finishes the rivet when the hammer is well secured and does not shake. The wood is placed so as not to put gashes in the pommel. Afterwards one makes a place for the rivet with a file or chisel. And some make the rivet [or attachment] in a diamond-shape but this is not as good as a round [topped one] because one cuts oneself on the corner of the rivet.

        The end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture of the nail. The best way is to apply some resin or glue but the resin is better. And the best is when the end is tightly set and so hot when set that powdered resin on the end melts, in that way it doesn't fall and can't be undone unless it is put in fire.
        
        Hilts are of different types:
        
        Ornate
        
        Guttered which is with round mouldings
        
        Pearled
        
        Scarfed when the bands are crosswise
        
        Onioned which is with a flat head
        
        In the King's manner, fully covered 
        
        The furbishers buy them by dozens, the dozen of full ones costs 10 lb. the worked one, 30 sols or [more] depending on its nature.
        
        
        
        The first thing that the apprentice does is to furbish as said.
        
        And then to adorn the sword and make a scabbard which is the summum of the art.
        
        They buy scabbards' wood pieces which are wholly made of beech wood, a hundred for 15 or 20 or 30 sols, depending on how far they are made.
        
        Theses wood pieces are thus called estelles, and have to be very clean and without any knots and are one finger thick.
        
        Then the furbisher puts them on a small bench, called a scabbard bench and with a small iron tool similar to the joiners' bench, they maintain it firmly.  Then with a plane, which is like a two-handled knife, they work the wood piece from the top, then use the joyner's plane to flatten it more. Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a

<heading>Casting</heading>

<block><activity type="casting"/><material>Tin</material> casts better when it is thin and delicate, than when it is thick, because when it is thick it contracts in high heat. So if you want to mold a thick piece in <material>tin</material>, mold it only one one side, and if it is possible, make it hollow on the other side. In this way your piece will be neater. And then you can solder two half pieces together. But if you have no choice but to mold it thick, make the shape of it and mold <foreign language="French">force abreuvouers</foreign> around the figure in this way.</block>

And because everything which is provided from the earth is mixed with some other substance, to purify it [the spalt], one boils it with somewhat large <material>gemstones</material> then tempers it with <material>essence of sal ammoniac</material>. One puts [a lump of it] <unit>the size of a walnut</unit> in a large <tool>bottle</tool> of <material>water</material> and <folio number="108v" url="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f222.image"/>that way one tempers it &amp; reducing it into small balls, [one] purges it of impurities [by] then putting it on to cook cleanly in a <tool>vessel of earth[enware]</tool> in a <tool>furnace</tool> like those in which <tool>pots</tool> [are made] and one leaves it there to the point at which <tool>pots</tool> would be fired.

Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it and do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the <animal>animal</animal> himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the <animal>lizard's</animal> throat more than you would do a <animal>snake</animal>, because the <animal>lizard</animal> has big jaws and big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the <material>wet sand</material> is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it and wipe each part again with a <tool>cloth made of swine hair</tool>, slightly dampened into <material>salt water</material> or <material>clear water</material>, do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered <animal>animal</animal> will be very neat. # <material>🝋</material> Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into <material>water</material> for a <foreign language="Latin">pater noster</foreign>. It will suck <material>water</material> inside, that way when you'll rub with <material>oil</material> the uncovered side, the <material>oil</material> will remain on the top, and to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking.

<block>This thus prepared, put your first half-mold on the disc of <material>clay</material>, surround it with a <material>clay</material> circle and do a thickness mark similar to the first one. Then, with a rather <tool>thick brush</tool>, wet with <material>spirits</material> all your <animal>animal's</animal> exposed half, without, if possible, missing any part, because therein lies the secret to casting neatly. Then, as fast as possible before the <material>spirits</material> evaporate, soak your <material>sand</material>, and cast it, shaking, blowing, and moving the mold, as you did for the first one, making sure that what you pour first on the <animal>animal</animal> is clearer than the rest, so that it is soaked everywhere and highlights the finer parts. So, leave it for fifteen <unit>minutes</unit> so it sets, then remove the <material>clay</material> circle and disc. And, with a <tool>knife</tool>, join you two molds together in a longish form, like a mandore, as we say, because of how you cast. Then soak a little in <material>water</material> the whole mold up to the level of the joints. Because this is another secret to separate them more easily. Otherwise, you would break everything. Separate them like this skillfully. After this, gently and patiently remove half of the <animal>animal</animal> still in the mold, pulling it sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, in order to avoid breaking it, or ruining parts of the mold. The mold, being empty, rejoin both half so that no <material>dust</material> comes in, and put them aside until you want to heat them up, make the <tool>runners</tool>, the <tool>vents</tool> and put the <tool>clamps</tool>.

<block position="left-top">If after both halfs of the <foreign language="French">noyau</foreign> have set and hardened, it would not open if you did not dip it into <material>water</material>.

<block position="left-middle">However, be sure that your second mold is thick enough, and hard enough otherwise it could break while dipping it into <material>water</material> if you want to open it.

<purpose type="making"/>

    <activity type="casting animals"/>
    <block> It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold [a crab] well because it is necessary to
        proceed differently [than you would] with other animals, because its shell is quite
        difficult to [...] and that is why it is necessary to reheat the mold three or four times.
        And on top of all that, it leaves a hard crust [that is] gray like ash. It is not molded
        from one piece and one cast as [is done with] plants. Rather, [it is moulded] in two casts
        as [is done] with <animal>serpents</animal> which are easily stripped from it [the mold].
        After it is opened, nimbly remove this crust with the very fine point of a
            <tool>pen-knife</tool> {and not with <tool>quicksilver</tool> which removes nothing from
        it} and likewise those small crusts of the second cast which get into the cavities that the
        sand or the molded animal made because it has curved legs. Here is the subtlety and the
        secret of stripping it. As you molded it [the crab] from the back side in the way [that you
        did for] the others [animals], remove the stomach and all the curved legs from it. Make your
        second cast in the way [that you did for] the other [animals], but as it will have set, take
        care that you not open the mold unless you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because
        of its curved legs, you would break the whole thing. Herein lies the subtlety. If, after it
        has been well reheated and opened, you see that the crust is not burned enough, reheat [it]
        until it is burned [enough]. </block>

    <block> Light your charcoals from the forge, then place them in a line in a corner of the forge
        according to the size of your mold, in order that it be surrounded with 3 or 4 fingers of
        charcoals, particularly at the bottom of the mole, where it is thicker. Then put your molds
        on these charcoals -- and not on a grate as some people do -- because they would get too
        strong a heat. Let your furnace heat up gradually for a while, always adding burning
        charcoal. As long as the mold is humid, your charcoal will be dampened at the bottom, but
        when it is dry, the charcoals start to blaze. When one side of the mold is dry, turn over;
        when both sides are dry and don't smoke anymore, increase the heat and cover your mold with
        burning coals. When the mold starts being red, do not blow on it with small bellows, because
        the mold would burst. Similarly, when your mold becomes red-hot, keep it well covered with
        burning charcoals and do not uncover it because it would crack. Prevent the draft from a
        window from reaching it. Then let it cool down. </block>

    <block> Take <material>latten</material> from <tool>skillet pans</tool>, used to make baby's
        cereal, which is doulx and apt for the cast. Some people say that <tool>counter</tool> from
            <place>Germany</place> contain a lot of <material>calamine</material>. However, when
        they are tempered, <material>calamine</material> evaporates, <material>calamine</material>
        mixed with melted <material>latten</material> always evaporates, because
            <material>latten</material> becomes red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting.
        However, fresh <material>calamine</material> and only fresh <material>calamine</material>,
        which is blended with remelted <material>latten</material>, makes
            <material>latten</material> run, and allow a clean cast. Because
            <material>calamine</material> which is added to remelted <material>latten</material> is
        half-damaged compared with its natural state. This half-damaged
            <material>calamine</material> make <material>latten</material> porous and agitated
        because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh
            <material>calamine</material> to melted <material>latten</material>. Make sure to cast
        your mold very hot, you mold must become red-hot, like molds to cast
            <material>gold</material>, <material>silver</material>, <material>copper</material> and
        metal. If you pour fresh <material>calamine</material>, avoid its smoke which is pernicious.
        To cast a medal, I took thirty <material>counters</material> from <place>Germany</place> and
        xii <material>clous de rosette</material> made of <material>doulx latton</material>, like
        for claires medals which are made of soft <material>latten</material>. This matter contains
        a lot of <material>calamine</material> like all kind of yellow <material>latten</material>,
        and make a lot of smoke which prevent <material>latten</material> from running, and make it
        porous, that is why it is necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, latten must be
        as white as water, or as melted <material>silver</material> or as a polished mirror of
        steel. The second fusion will come out much better because evaporated
            <material>calamine</material> does not make as much smoke. If you use a molding frame
        that does not break and holds its own, the second [casting] will come more neatly out of the
        mold, because the frame is impregnated with the smoke of <material>calamine</material>. If
        you add <material>sal ammoniac</material> to your <material>latten</material>, this latten
        will be clear and shiny, but will be even more shiny with <material>huile
            tingente</material>. Do not use another <material>sand</material> than the above
        mentioned to mold a <material>noyau</material>, and the mold must become red-hot, like a

        red, like <material>gold</material>, <material>silver</material>, <material>latten</material>, and metal. You will know that it is hot enough when it is
        clear and shining like a newly polished steel mirror, or like melted silver. Protect it from

    <heading>Wetting sand to mold flat medals</heading>
    <purpose type="making"/>
    <activity type="casting"/>
    
    <block> Flat medals, made of <material>wax</material> or metal, must be oiled very lightly and then touched with a
        brush of <material>spirits</material>. So that the already moistened mold takes well the oiled thing without
        rejecting it, one warms the water well in order to wet the <material>sand</material>, because with cold water it
        would be rejected. It is necessary to <material>oil</material> medals, because they do not expand and in this way
        would break the mold. Animals, which expand, do not need oiling. The hot water much be of
        such a heat that you cannot keep your figure in it without it becoming too warm. Wet the
        thickest sand for flat and solid medals rather than [for] <animal>lizards</animal> and finer things. Once
        your <material>sand</material> has set, clean and scrape your mold on one side and the other, and on the bottom
        edge of the thrown side of the medal, make a notch so that it is easier to take out. Lower
        the mold, scraping what surrounds the medal, so that on all sides you can take it out easily
        without it damaging the mold. Then make some gashes around the first mold used to throw so
        that the second time that you throw in it, it will be identical to the first one, and in the
        same way, make a notch at the bottom of the mold, where the held of the item cast lies. Also
        make some [gashes] in the sides of the cast. This done, wet the back of the first mold in
        oiled water, and after the second casting moisten it with warm water if you have molded your
        medal in a <material>noyau</material> mold. Having done the first cast, and this one having set, cut around the
        edge of the medal with the point of a knife so that it comes out of the throw and is not
        buried in it. Then having made the second cast, and having opened your mold, take away the
        medal in one go, with two <tool>knife</tool> points, one on the side of the cast object and one on the
        side of the head, which is at the opposite end. </block>
    <block position="left-middle">Take care not to <material>oil</material> your medal too much because if the seeps out,
        it prevents the sand from serving its purpose and coming together and renders it wavy and
        lumpy. You must only touch the middle of the medal with the tip of your oil brush and then
        smear the oil everywhere. </block>

    <block position="left-bottom"> Make especially sure that the throw is as wide as you can on the
        medal and holds it together well. The gate of your cast must always be big and always
        narrowing as you go towards the medal. Also do not forget to notch the gate of your cast. </block>

    <folio number="138r" url="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f281.image"/>
    <block> If you want to cast <material>gold</material>, <material>silver</material>, <material>copper</material> or brass, it is necessary that they be
        perfectly red, and fired on the inside when you cast, and perfectly reheated twice, if there
        is something inside to be burnt and cleaned. </block>
    <block> The molds of animals that you burn must be reheated in such a manner that the animal
        burns up. But if it has big bones, it is frustrating to take out and ☿ often breaks delicate
        things because of its heaviness. One does not put ☿in molds that can open. It is often molds
        for flowers that do not open because they are cast in one go. </block>
    <block> When you want to reheat your molds, fix <tool>cramp-irons</tool> on the joints, so that when they
        reheat they will not bend, contract or break. This is done once the cast is made. </block>
    <block> The scrapings of the mold can also be used instead of bricks after being reheated, and
        also the leftover bits of the mold that have already been used. You can also pat it over
        important things, like works in gold or silver. You can also reheat it and blend it with
        water diluted with <material>sal ammoniac</material>, like <material>spar</material> from <place>Germany</place>, and is excellent <material>sand</material> for box molds
        for all metals. </block>
    <block> The molds with things that need to be burnt out inside them, those ones will not open
        until the thing that is inside is burnt, like the molds for <animal>crayfish</animal>, <animal>crab</animal>, <animal>great-horned
            beetles</animal>. Do not open the molds in which you will burn something, not before the thing is
        burnt, it could be crayfishes, crabs, stag beetles, pictures, and pieces of <material>wax</material> and <material>black
            sulphur</material>, which do not come out of the mold [easily]. </block>
    <block> You must not mold on <material>brick</material> or <material>wood</material> because they absorb and attract water too early, and
        do not allow the sand to set. The best place for [the sand] is on a fresh layers of <material>clay</material>.
        And yet, I have experienced that <material>grey earth</material> dries out the mold too quickly. <material>Yellow [earth]</material>
        is better. </block>
    <block position="left-middle">For medals, and flat things, the sand must be quite thick and
        moistened so that it sets quickly. And when the sand is thusly thick, you can shake and move
        the table where you mold lies, so that [the movement] makes the <material>sand</material> go everywhere. But when
        the sand is clear, as for flowers and herbs, you cannot shake it, nor can you do it when
        there is something attached to wax or other things which are prone to come off, such as the
        legs of <animal>crayfish</animal> or other similar things. And if by chance your sand is too thick, you must
        quickly add some water. And having put the sand in the water, examine it until it is thick
        on the bottom and clear on top. The clearest is thrown in immediately and then bubbles and
        the thickest is thrown in at the end so that it strengthens the mold. </block>

                <material>lead</material> that is impure.<!-- </activity> -->The mold is made out of the
        aforementioned <material>sand</material>, common for all metals, when it is reheated, leave
        it to cool until you can put your finger in it without causing a breach in the gate of the
        cast. As for the <material>lead</material>, it is melted in a <tool>crucible</tool> with a
        bellows' fire until both the <tool>crucible</tool> and the <material>lead</material> are
        red. When it gets to that state, cleanse it anew with <material>charcoal</material> or with
        a specially made <tool>scraper</tool> or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done,
        leave it to rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw in a
        bit of <material>resin</material> to burn away the filth. However, some think it best not to
        put any in because it leaves filth. But when they are ready to cast, they cannot forget to
        also thrown in a bean-size quantity of <material>bismuth</material> for each pound of
            <material>lead</material>. And it must be as red as the melted metal when it enters the
        mold. If the mold is large, it is much better to put in in a <tool>press</tool> so that they
        join well and so that the <material>lead</material> does not come out of the mold. However,
        should this happen, and that for the first, second or third time your mold does not fill up,
        cast heartily because for as long as your metal is red it will mix and join with the other
        one and will come out very neatly like the main one. The same thing can be said for pure
            <material>tin</material> used for thin things. And that way for doing pure
            <material>tin</material> is one <unit>℥</unit> of new <material>lead</material> for one
            <unit>lb</unit>. of the former. Large molds must be put in a press held tightly between
        two <tool>layers of copper</tool>, and then bury the whole thing in
            <material>sand</material>, which is better than ashes, because being heavy, it will seal
        better. Otherwise large molds are prone to open because the metal is heavy. Some make square

            Take some <material>white wax</material> which is much more
            appropriate for this kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does
            not leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you propose, and no
            more. And [take] a half quantity of ground <material>coal</material> and neatly sieved
            through a <tool>cloth</tool> or <tool>coal sleeve</tool>, using it to give some color to your <material>wax</material>,
            that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as
            clearly. Put your <material>wax</material> on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and
            well-liquified, have, for a full <tool>eared-porringer</tool> of melted wax, as much
                <material>sulphur</material> as a large walnut. Pulverize it. Melt it over a slow
            fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hard.
            But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished
            bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the wax that you will have
            previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join
            together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the charcoal that
            has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is
            how you will know that your wax has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release
            no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle,
            and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able
            to separate your <material>wax</material> from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the
            right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized
                <material>charcoal</material> is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of
            the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go,

            can cast two or three times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of
            pulverized <material>white plaster</material> &amp; reheated in the manner of the <material>sand</material>
            from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it is used many
            times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in cold water, &amp; at a minimum,
            at least as long in hot water that at first is so hot that you can't hold your finger in
            it. And note that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall without water
            seeping into it. In removing it closed from the hot water, cast your <material>wax</material> in such a state
            of heat as has been described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily
            come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before opening it so
            that the cast thing not break. You will know that the casting is good when the <material>wax</material>
            coming back out of the mold is thin and even. Remember to make several castings along
            the whole length of the mold so that in this way the wax runs better. Make the
                first<figure identifier="fig_p140r_1"

            as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and
            in so doing does not come out neatly, it's all the same, because you have to face the
            fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know
            whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them
            if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And
            the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you
            more than one hundred times if it Is well governed. But it is good to soak it one night
            or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits
            made from sugar. This <material>wax</material> is very soft &amp; friendly &amp; pliant, like <material>copper</material>. And if
            it is hard [this is] because of <material>sulfur</material>, which makes it melt more
            easily than than other [wax], so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the
            <material>sulfur</material> that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, [as] cracks
            on the bottom. Having in this way passed through wax, it will not catch fire at all when
            put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal
            [illegible]. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to [illegible]. </block>

    <block purpose="making"> The <animal>crayfish</animal> is one of the most fantastical to cast,
        but also <!-- <activity type="reference"> -->provides an example for casting
            other difficult things<!-- </activity>  -->. You can distinguish males and female by the eggs that
        the females carry, and by the four little white back legs that males have in their tails
        after behind main eight legs. It is good to dry them out a bit so that the bumps come out
        more hard and beautiful, because none of what is made of shell shrinks. It is true that
        should you dry the little inside legs for too long, they become diminished and have no body.
        If they are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales. Be sure then to maintain the mean.
        They have certain hairs between the legs and at the end of the tail. And because all hair is
        difficult to cast, because it gets mixed up in the sand and does not release, you can burn
        it by putting a <tool>hot iron</tool> on the <animal>crayfish</animal> so that it the hair cannot be seen. As
        for animals that have hair or feathers, you must grease the hair with <material>wheat
            oil</material>, which is very dry and which will make the hair lay flat and straight. In
        this way, you will have form of your animal and you will have the hair. Should it the hair
        be wavy, it can be repaired. If your crayfish has eggs, which are delicate, and which will
        be difficult to take out of the mold without breaking, you would do better to make the first
        cast with the crayfish on its belly and eggs. In this way, you will open the mold with it
        the <animal>crayfish</animal> on its back, which will be hard and easy to manipulate. And the belly and the
        eggs will remain in the mold. And rather than opening your mold for the second time, you
        will have to burn it with them in it. This way, it will open easily, and what has been
        burned will come away cleanly. In this way, the second casting, which is done on the first
        one that has successfully taken hold, separates easily from the first, after having been
        refired. This is a singular secret for similar moldings. </block>

        of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, since they turn out better. You could make your
        cast in one great piece, but it would be troublesome to cut. It is best to do it in three or
        4 parts, which will be thicker close to the animal, and include the most amount of edge that
        is close to the cast/mold. Make as well some casting conduits all the way from the end of
        the cast,</block>

        make the wax casting conduits thus, because in this way you can cast the second mold after

Because if the mold is hot, the <material>☿</material> will go inside; seek out the conduits in escaping, will leave its own odor, which will aggravate the tin or other metal that you will cast, such that it will break in touching the mold at all. The heat of the mold also retains some little grains of <material>☿</material> that will make lumps; stick to the sides of the molded leaves and attach to them; make them frangible. The <material>☿</material> cleans ashes well. Likewise flat things where there are not delicate traces that it could break with its weight. And therefore, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, don't use it at all. But if you have need of it, mix your <material>crocum sand</material> so that it withstands fire well. And after having put in the <material>☿</material>, evacuate it, bouncing the end of the mold from below while moving it.

This is why you mold in two halves: so that once the mold is opened after having been refired, the thing you've burnt can be cleaned out. <purpose type="advice">But I advise letting it cool so that in taking off the clamps (being hot) nothing cracks while it is still fragile. While it is hot the crust and cinders which it leaves and which stick to the mold can be more easily removed when it is cold. Also note that on the side of the lower mold when you reheat the animal, which in boiling leaves a crust, in this case, always mark on the mold where the back of the animal is so that in reheating it is to the top and above and will by this method stay cleaner.</purpose></block>

<block><material>Mortars</material> are made of the best alloy of <material>"métal"</material> and the finest possible <material>rosette</material> so that they do not burst, that is to say one part "métal" and two [parts] fine rosette or <material>old caudron</material>, which is even better. Some of them are of <unit>fifteen or seventeen lb.</unit> and are loaded with <unit>two and a half lb.</unit> of <material>grain powder</material>, and they are put on common windows and doors. Others are of a weight of <unit>25 to 27 lb.</unit> and are loaded with <unit>eight lb.</unit> of <material>powder</material>. And in such a way, they are made according to the stress they have to resist. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the inside, they are made like a crucible</block>

<block>narrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of <material>powder</material> they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of <unit>4 s. lb.</unit> are eight lines thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 lines. They have <unit>xiii "poulsses"</unit> long and <unit>seven in diameter</unit> at the mouth and opening.</block>

<folio

<block>The ones weighing about <unit>27 lb.</unit> are <unit>ix "pousses" long</unit> and the mouth is <unit>6 [pousses]</unit> in diameter. At their bottom, they are <unit>6 "lignes"</unit> thick, and <unit>3</unit>for the mouth. The ones weighing <unit>17 lb</unit> are <unit>8 "poulsses"</unit> long and the mouth is <unit>five</unit>. They are all covered together, all the <material>forks</material>, <material>rods</material>, and tools which one uses, with a big <tool>canvas</tool> or big <tool>cloth</tool> so that they do not make any noise. It is good that they sit loaded for a while. After the <material>powder</material> has been put in, it is grinded very hard and then tightly pressed paper is put in, then a cake of well pressed <material>wax</material> and, on the wax, another slab of <material>cork</material> that fits in very snugly and that you have to force in. In this way, the powder remains well packed and gives much greater force, and if you wish, you can put on the cork slab one of <material>wood</material> pierced in the middle, if the mortar has a pierced bottom, which is believed to be the easiest and which makes a greater hole because it cannot recoil. And for these that have a pierced bottom, one must have a good gimlet to first make the hole so that the rod, which is made by the point of the gimlet, has before and without noise attached the mortar. And for these, one must cover the button, which is quite sharply filed, with waxed canvas, or add <material>wax</material> to it so that it completely plugs the hole in the bottom. But because the doors are sometimes iron and the <material>iron rods</material> cannot pierce it, an iron fork made like pincers and another iron stick made with three claws, like you see painted, are use. And in this way, the mortar stays in place well and is immediately steadied. The iron rods must come out of the mortar from every point made by the gimlet, namely by <unit>three or 4 finger lengths</unit>, which all enter in the door. When the mortars are placed, the touch-hole is filled with good powder and inserted in it is a feather shaft filled with tightly pressed powder and moistened with <material>vinegar</material>, or if needed, the powder is firmly pressed with the palms of the hands and, having wet it with some saliva, you shape it like a cocoon or</block>

The small mortars of <unit>16 or 17 lb.</unit> are attached promptly with a short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of <unit>27 lb.</unit>, but then we only put <unit>three lb.</unit> of powder. The door really needs to be strong so as not to be blown off for <unit>seventeenth lb.</unit> mortars. Some people use little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others load two canons of <material>guns</material> and, with a <material>gimlet</material> and a string, tie them with the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.</block>

        <purpose type="making"/> This is a secret that is hardly known to common painters. Some take
        the most delicate they can &amp; crush it with <material>ceruse</material>, which binds it,
        and next prick with an <tool>awl</tool> in several places the area they want to paint with
                <material><foreign language="french">azur d’esmail</foreign></material>, such that
        the <material>oil</material> enters &amp; leaks in, &amp; does not cause the
            <material>azure</material>, which in itself is heavy, to run. Others lay the panel flat
        &amp; apply the <material>azure</material> on it, which is also done <foreign
            language="french">à destrempe</foreign>. The main thing is to crush it well on
                <tool><material>marble</material></tool>, and before that, to have washed it
        thoroughly. Some grind it with thoroughly with an <material>egg yolk</material> &amp; then
        wash it in five or six lots of <material>water</material> and lay it on not with a
                <tool><foreign language="french">painceau</foreign></tool>, which would be too soft,
        but with a <tool><foreign language="french">broisse</foreign></tool> highly softened &amp;
        bent, &amp; laying it on thickly as if one were applying it with a <tool>trowel</tool>;
        settling down it evens out and flattens. I have experienced that crushing <material><foreign
                language="french">azur d’esmail</foreign></material> with <material>egg
            yolk</material> &amp; then washing it in several lots of <material>water</material> is
        good, although it loses a little of its vividness in the crushing of it. I have also washed
        it in several lots of <material>water</material> &amp;, when it had settled a little, I
        removed the <material>water</material>, still q blue, with a <tool>sponge</tool> and
        squeezed it into another vessel thus where it settled, &amp; from the residue I had the
            <material>ash</material>, <material><plant>flower</plant></material> and subtlest part
        of the <material>azure</material> without crushing it, which is the best, for in the
        crushing of it, it loses some of its color. Those who make it in <place>Germany</place>
        compose it like <material>enamel</material>, in large pieces which they <tool>pestle</tool>,
        &amp; pass through several <tool>sieves</tool> &amp; wash. </block>
    <block><purpose type="making"/> To make <material>azures</material> beautiful, they wash or soak
        them in a <material_format>rock <material>water</material></material_format>, as they call
        it; it is a <material>water</material> distilled from mines where <material>azure</material>
        or <material><foreign language="french">vert d'azur</foreign></material> is found, which
        distills naturally through the mountain's veins or is distilled with an <tool>alembic</tool>

                d’esmail</foreign></material> cannot be worked if it is too coarse. Try it,
        therefore, on the fingernail or the <tool><material>oil</material> palette</tool>. If it
        happens to be sandy, do not crush it except with the <material>egg yolk</material> or,
        better yet, wash it in <material_format>clear <material>water</material></material_format>
        &amp; with a sponge remove the <material_format>colored
            <material>water</material></material_format> after it starts to go to the bottom, and in
        this manner you will extract the quite delicate <material><plant>flower</plant></material>,

    <heading>To <color>white</color>n <material>enilanroc</material></heading>

    <block>Some believe the ceruse-color crust that is on top to be natural. Others say that it is a
        lost secret of ancient <profession>lapidaries</profession>. Others say that it is
            <material>enamel</material> that has been reheated. And, from this crust, one can form
        multiple ciphers, letters, circles and other bizarre motifs. As to the means, I proceeded
        thus: I once wanted to add a layer of <material>arsenic</material> ground on
            <material>marble</material>. However, I did the experiment without it, and I put the
        above mentioned thing, <material>enilanroc</material>, in a <tool>small
                <material>iron</material> casket</tool> on the <tool>fire</tool> of my
                <tool><profession>goldsmith</profession>'s forge</tool> with three or four
            <material_format>small half-burnt <material>coal</material>s</material_format> and blew
        on it only with my <tool>mouth</tool>. However, the thing caught fire and became all <color>white</color>,
        not only on its surface but also inside. And then I let it cool on its own near the <tool>fire</tool>,
        since otherwise, exposing it suddenly to cold air, it would have cracked. While it was all
        <color>white</color>, I passed it through my <tool><material>lead</material> wheel</tool> and I found it to be as hard as it was before. And
        after scraping off a little of the <color>white</color>, I found it to be of <color>a clear fleshy tone</color>. Finally,
        I polished it and observed that it took quite a beautiful polish luster and that it could
        compare with a quite beautiful <material>agate</material> for the purpose of engraving it with some beautiful
        face and applying it to a table of</block>

    <folio number="013r" url="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f31.image"/>

    <block> <material>agate</material> of various colors. But because this overall <color>white</color>ness did not correspond with the
        <color>white</color> crust on the surface that I was seeking, leaving the rest of the thing its <color>natural
            color</color>, I made a hole in a <tool><material>brick</material></tool>, precisely the same size as the object, and put it inside.
        Then I heated two <tool><profession>glassmaker</profession>'s soldering iron</tool>s until they became <color>red</color> hot and, when they were
        <color>red</color> hot, I applied them one after the other onto the surface of the object until I got the
        <color>white</color> crust I was looking for, on which I made the drawing that I wanted, revealing the <color>red</color>
        background, with a <tool>diamond point</tool>, and I polished it with <tool>hog bristles</tool> and <tool><material>tripoli</material></tool>. I don't
            know if it would be better to reheat it under <tool><material_format>hot <material>ashes</material></material_format></tool>, and if it would be good to encase
            it in <tool><material>alabaster</material></tool>, which is quite cold, as I did in the <tool><material>brick</material></tool>.

        interspersed with <material_format>S.S.S-shaped branches of
                <material><plant>heather</plant></material></material_format> or similar things,
        then they tamp it down and beat it with <tool>beaters of three different forms</tool>. One
        is called the <tool>mall</tool>, which has a triangular form like A, and this is used
        firstly to tamp down the <material>earth</material>. Then one uses another made of
            <tool>pointed <material>woodblocks</material> fitted onto a thick stick</tool>, and this
        one is used to properly press the <material>earth</material> at the wall’s ends and edges
        where they adhere to the <tool>boards</tool>, and is called [blank]. The other one is called
        the <tool>bat</tool> and is used to flatten and beat the <material>earth</material> for the
        last time, as shown in C. Then one makes another layer of <material>earth</material> and
                <material><plant>heather</plant></material> and beats as has been said, and
        continues thus until completing the wall, which is covered with
                <material><plant>heather</plant></material> and then with
        <material>earth</material>. Some intersperse the said wall with rows of
            <material>bricks</material>. They also make walls with a sloped foot, adding width to
        the foundations according to how high they want to build the wall. When it is old it
            <color>white</color>ns, showing that it has <material>saltpeter</material> in it. Which
        is why, when they fall down, <profession>gunpowder</profession> makers profit from
        them.</block>

    <heading>Damask Cloth</heading>

    <block>You can make damask cloth of two different colours and imitate embroidery without adding
        anything else to it, as follows. Once it is is dyed <color>yellow</color>, pounce onto it
        such a pattern as will please you. Then you will sew some <tool>string or a bigger
            cord</tool> loosely onto the pattern and throw it into a dye of
            <material>woad</material> or <material>pastel</material> and it will become
            <color>green</color>, except that which is beneath the <tool>string</tool>, which will
        remain <color>yellow</color> because the <color>green</color> dye will not have penetrated
        there. And you can do the same with other colours and, instead of <tool>string or
            cord</tool>, add some <tool>pieces of poor quality cloth cut in <name type="group"
                >Moorish</name> shapes</tool> on top of the first colour. In that manner, you will
        have cheap embroidery.</block>

    <heading>Casting <material>metal</material>s</heading>

    <block>Candlesticks and small works are cast in a <tool>frame</tool> with
            <material>sand</material>. Having stamped the work, sprinkle it with
            <material>flour</material> in order to make the <material>copper</material> or
            <material>latten</material> run better. When the <material>sand</material> has been in
        use for one month, it is necessary to take some new <material>sand</material> because that
        which has been used, being reheated +, dries &amp; loses its binding power. Yet it is used
        mixed with the new <material>sand</material>, because it makes the work less porous. Large
        works such as artillery, bells and similar things are cast in <material>earth</material>,
        and <material>copper</material> cast in <material>earth</material> makes less crust and is
            <color>white</color>r than when cast in <material>sand</material>. The
            <material>earth</material> is <material_format>sandy
            <material>clay</material></material_format> mixed with <material><animal>horse</animal>
            dung</material> and <material_format><material>cloth</material> waste</material_format>.
        The <material>earth</material> that has been used for casting, which is
        <color>black</color>, baked and as if burnt, is mixed with <material_format>artificial
                <material>sand</material></material_format>, and is very good. For softening and
        making the <material>copper</material> run, once it is melted, one throws in some
            <material>lead</material>, which does not form an alloy but is found on the surface of
        the cast.</block>

    <block>The <material>sand</material> must be made from something very dry and arid and reheated

            <material>silver</material> would leap out of the <tool>mold</tool> and sustain damage.
        It is also necessary for the <material>earth</material> to absorb the
            <material>metal</material> because <material_format>cast
            <material>gold</material></material_format> or <material_format>cast

    <heading>Tracing a history on glass</heading>

    <block>If you want to trace a history in intaglio on <material>glass</material>, you can do so
        in different ways. Place your glass pane on, as thin as possible, over the printed history,
        &amp; having cleaned the glass well with <material>lye</material> &amp;
            <material>ashes</material> so that it is not at all greasy, trace over the lines visible
        to you with oily black or scales black with a <tool>pinceau</tool>, if you want to paint
        with colors in the manner of glaziers, who spread a wash of scales black all over their
        glass pane &amp; then scratch &amp; uncover what they want to coat with color, leaving that
        which is necessary for shading. But if you want to make gilt histories on glass with a
        background of colors, which imitates the basse-taille of goldsmiths, gild the whole glass
        pane with <material>gum water</material> or <material>garlic juice</material> or
            <material>fig-tree milk</material>. Then moisten your printed history with two wet
            <tool>linen cloths</tool> &amp; lay it down on the gilt glass. Then with a
            <tool>pin</tool> mounted on a small <tool>stick</tool>, follow the lines of your history
        as if you wished to pounce it, &amp; thus you shall vividly trace it on the gilding of the
        glass. &amp; next you shall uncover the background &amp; what needs to be empty with a quite
        pointy steel <tool>awl</tool>, &amp; and neatly follow once more the lines &amp; accomplish
        your work &amp; fashion your faces &amp; flesh tones in <material>pounded silver</material>;
        then fill the background with <material>azur d’esmail</material> or
            <material>verdigris</material> or <material>fine laque platte</material>, tempered with
        clear <material>turpentine</material>, mixed with a little <material>larme de
            mastic</material> if you want the colors to be more unified &amp; not to run. Next,
        apply on the back of the glass &amp; over the colors a white <tool>tin sheet</tool>. And
        once this is dry, you can cover the tin sheet of with color to hide your secret. The tin
        sheet gives light to the colors. Thus you will be able to paint without being</block>

    <block>being at all expert in painting. If your glass pane is bulging as if taken from the belly
        of a jar, it will show better. When you apply your turpentine colors to your glass panes,
        first place them on a <tool>hot tile</tool> &amp;, once they are hot, spread your colors
        &amp; leave it a while on the tile, then lay down your tin sheet.</block>

        then put it through a <tool>sieve</tool> to make it fine and free from gravel, which would
        prevent it from casting cleanly. The manure makes the earth more amenable [to casting] &amp;
        easier to work with, but it should be free of straw and other things. And when the earth is
        very fat, you have to add more sand and more manure. But one does find fat varieties of
        earth [that are] naturally mixed with sand. If they are not, make them so artificially. One
        should always cook the soils again before casting.</block>

    <heading>Colors and gilt on glass</heading>
    <block>You should not put as strong <material>gummed water</material> on
            <material>glass</material> for the silver layer as for the gold layer because a
            <material>silver leaf</material> is twice as strong as <material>gold leaf</material>.
        Also, silver is harder and therefore does not scratch as easily. And if
            <material>gum</material> was not a little [too] strong for silver, it would not crack so
        clearly. When you work, the exhalation of your breath humidifies the leaf lying on the
        glass, and therefore it would be good, when working, to heat it up a few times. You have to
        very thoroughly wash what you want to be empty and used as a surface painted with colors,
        because if it is not really clean of the gum's grease and viscosity, and of other things,
        the colors will not be so clear on it. To advance your work you can smooth with a
            <tool>pumice stone</tool>, or [you can do this] to better lay down gum and leaf on a cut
            <tool>paper</tool>. This way, you will have to do very little repairs. If you want a
        gold color there without gold, mix soaked dried <material>saffron</material> with a little

    <heading>Wax for seals and impressions</heading>

    <block>For large wax seals, you should always have tepid <material>water</material> handy, and
        keep your <material>wax</material> in it. Yet previously you should have kneaded it with
        your hands, so as to make it very smooth and even, for otherwise the water would penetrate
        the wax and prevent it from holding together. Afterwards, you can imprint whatever you want.
        Cover the wax in three or four sheets of <material>paper</material>, and, with a round and
        smooth <tool>stick</tool> similar to a <tool>pestle</tool>, roll it out as if to polish it.
        It will then stick to the paper, helping you to take it off from the seal. In this way you
        will imprint better than if you were dripping molten wax. You can carve figures and color
        them in gold, in silver, or paint them with <material>couleurs à vernis</material>, and
        transfer them onto a <material>glass pane</material> painted with <material>couleurs à

    <heading>Arquebusier</heading>

    <block>To shoot your <tool>arquebus</tool> precisely the end of the breech must come precisely
        on the edge of the light, because like this the <material>powder</material> catches [fire]
        and burns all at once without blowing and has more strength and does not recoil. On the
        contrary, if the breech is made hollow, as they commonly are, the powder catches more
        quickly in this place, makes it recoil, and blows. This is clearly shown [by] a arquebus
        with a chamber which recoils more than another. And since the cannon is bigger at the breech
        than at the muzzle the sights are also uneven, because that at the breech is higher than
        that at the muzzle. Additionally, the thickness of the cannon is greater than the caliber by
        about one line, and the sight by another. It would therefore be necessary to either make the
        cannon all of one size or to raise the barrel from the end and towards the muzzle, and push
        it in and lower towards the breech. The weight of the powder must be one third of the
        [weight of the] <tool>bullet</tool>.</block>

    <block>It is necessary to make a <tool>wooden pipe</tool> 4 or 5 fingers wide that is perfectly
        hollow, according to the open end of your barrel, of the form represented in A. Then, having
        cut some <material>paper</material>, which has to be as strong as that of large printed
        books, in the form indicated in D and as wide as you want your cartridge to be long, wrap
        the paper around the <tool>baton</tool> B and at the top, where the pointed tip F will be
        around the aforementioned paper, and the cartridge will be formed. But, in order to make the
        bottom more uniform, put it into <tool>pipe</tool> A, then introduce baton B and, in the
        other end of the pipe, which is marked G, insert baton C and pack so as to compact and press
        the folded tip of your cartridge, then take it out, and the charge in this, put three or
        four drageons or <material>larmes</material>. Then, with a <tool>punch</tool>, marked E, of
        the same caliber of your arquebus or pistol, punch round pieces on cardboard or felt or
        waxed cloth, and put this round piece into your cartridge, and push it until the drageons
        with the baton B, the more drageons, 3 or 4, then a round piece. And continue like that
        until the cartridge is full, the put it into the <tool>arquebus</tool>. If you want your
        pellet to scatter earlier, make round pieces out of paper. If you want it to reach further
        without scattering, make the piece out of <material>cardboard</material>. If you want it to
        reach even further, make the round piece out of <material>waxed cloth</material>, or either
        of <material>leather</material> or <material>felt</material>, and a piece of waxed cloth on
        the top. And if you make the cartridge in part with waxed cloth or <material>waxed
            paper</material>, it will reach one hundred paces and will make a big hole, and the
        pellet, barely scattering, will produce a big opening. But if you make your cartridge with
        waxed cloth or a material stronger than paper, it cannot be so long, with the cardboard tip
        being like in D, because it is enough if it wrapped around twice. In such a way, the pellet
        barely scatters and makes a big hole in porte-corps armor or others.</block>

<heading><material>Azure enamel</material> with <material>oil</material></heading>

<block purpose="making">One must choose the finest possible, for if it is coarse one cannot work in oil. And if you cannot find any that is fine enough, you may as well grind it, not with <material>water</material> but with <material>oil</material>, and grind it thick. Then lay it on your palette and mix in some <material>turpentine</material> but not much, to make it bind, and make it as thick as butter or mortar, and then, with a large enough <tool>brush</tool>, work it while always moving the brush freely. Then, to soften it, make jagged hatching movements with the tip of the brush. The highlights will be made using the same diluted with <material>ceruse</material>, which makes it bind, making it easier to work. I have seen it used thus. It must be very thick, so that you almost need an effort to spread it with your <tool>brush</tool>. And it will be all the better if you lay down your painting. All these difficulties do not occur when it is very fine and fluid without being crushed, and it doesn't run.

In such cases, it is better to scrape off the old layer and prime again and then apply the <color>azure</color>. It is the same for almost all other colors. Also <color>azure</color> mixed with <material>oil</material> always remains shiny, which is not good for azure because that makes it fade.

<heading>Perspectives</heading>

<block>Painting perspectives in oil takes a long time because of the many lines that need to be drawn with a <tool>ruler</tool>, and for that reason one generally paints them in <material>distemper</material>. One chooses the vanishing points at will. The main thing is to know where the point is. One commonly sets two or three, sometimes up to five.

<heading>Drawing</heading>

<block purpose="painting">After you have primed your panel and scraped it with a <tool>knife</tool> to make it quite even, you will start drawing with the longest possible piece of <material>charcoal</material>, because with a short one you would not see your line so well and you would make it rougher. Let the tip of the <material>charcoal</material> be sharp, and to prevent if from quickly becoming dulled and blunt, drag the tip flat, thus you will constantly sharpen it. Hold your <material>charcoal</material> as far as possible, and accustom yourself to drawing with a light touch. Because if you become accustomed to drawing delicately with charcoal, you shall do the same with colors. And whoever is rough with charcoal is never exquisite with colors. And by a line of charcoal, masters assess their apprentices. First make the contour of your drawing, that is the outline, lightly and without too diligent work, rather with boldness. By so doing, you will learn to be an artist, and if you need to erase anything, you will not waste as much time as if you had elaborated it. Afterwards work on all the details, not standing too close to your panel, but sometimes stepping back in order to better assess the proportions. Once you are satisfied with the first drawing, retrace all the lines with your <tool>paintbrush</tool> in <color>pink</color> or another gummed or distempered color. Thus you will work more surely with colors, and with less trouble.

<heading>Perspective</heading>

<block>In order to tell where the vanishing point is one must lay a <tool>ruler</tool> over the lines, and the point will be where the lines meet. Some make a hole at the end of their <tool>rulers</tool> in order to fix the point by that hole while moving the <tool>ruler</tool> about. Others lay a <tool>ruler</tool> across the <tool>panel</tool>,, then on this ruler they place the tip of another <tool>ruler</tool> which, being attached to the former by a <tool>screw</tool>, will move about and reach as far as necessary without losing the point. The <tool>ruler</tool> and <tool>compass</tool> without discernment of the eye will cause errors. Perspective is very difficult.

<heading>Founders of small <material>tin</material> work</heading>

<block>
  They usually cast from soft <material>solder</material> the things that should not become hollow, because hollow works require fine and <material>soft tin</material>. However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they are mixed or include <material>glass tin</material>  in them, just like they mix a little <sup><material>glass tin</material></sup> in the <material>soft tin</material>. They carve their work on <material>stones</material> of which the sharpening stones or barber's files are made. These are found in great flakes near the <place>mountains</place>, and resemble <material>slate</material>. They are found in three colors: one reddish, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain heat ; <sup>another</sup> one  is the color of dark <material>slate</material>, and the other is whitish. When they work a relief, first they print it on <material>carton</material>, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their <material>stones</material> and rubbing them together , they use a <tool>compass</tool> or <tool>little iron tools</tool> to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four <material>stones</material>, to make a circle or a square with the <material>stones</material> which join perfectly because the <material>stones</material> are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with <material>tallow</material>, and it <sup>the mould</sup> absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having <sup>put</sup> fine powder of <material>quicklime</material> into a <tool>cloth</tool>, they rub the mould using pounce in beating the <material>linen</material> on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles <sup>from forming</sup>. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown <sup>on the picture</sup>. They make a hole in the <m>medal</m>, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the <material>medal</material>.

        Dust guards wheat against being worm-eaten. And to clean it well when it is stained &amp; like rust, pass some ashes through a sieve and mix them with the wheat, then sift the whole thing with a bolting cloth made from rough cloth or canvas. The ashes will pass through &amp; your wheat will stay nicely yellow &amp; very fine.

        After they have been dryly ground and beaten in the mortar, they are ground finely on the marble. I mixed the same quantity of each material, and in order to mix them better, I ground them on the porphyry again, and then filtered this through a double sieve or the sleeve of a shirt. Then, I put them on sheets of paper and stored it on marble in a cellar. In one night, they were both moist enough [that there there was no need] to dampen them further because rock salt, like all other salts, dissolves in dampness. I molded with this very neatly because both should be quite fine. They need to be moist enough so it can be removed easily.

    <heading>Mineral sand</heading>
    
    <block>
        It does not matter if the sand color is white or yellow. Above all it the sand must be lumped together much like a precious stone or a stone, and the deeper in the earth one gets it from, the better. The signs of its quality is that it is thus gathered together, that, if the stone is removed as it should be i.e. in the correct way, it forms pieces and  lumps together, which demonstrates its capacity for binding, and that it the sand is not too dry.
        
        However, it should crumble in your hands. And the grain must be  quite small, fine, and homogeneous. If this sand is not fine enough, you can filter it and grind it up finely either with water, or through a sieve, when it or on the porphyry. That way it loses its dryness and becomes greasy and well bound. You can mold it in  a box mold or in a noyau without wadding, and try it with lead because, if it does not swell and casts neatly, it will bear out well too. Some say that fatty sands do not work for casting metal that is too hot. Artisans who undertake a big job and who want to save money do not need to crush sand and seek the curious properties of artificial sand; they have more to profit from finding natural sand that has the finest grain possible. And for a small job, they take advantage of finding the finest natural sand they can. For a smaller job, they only filter the sand through the sieve. But those who work on a very small scale crush the sand and grind it finely until it becomes impalpable, because they do not need as much sand.

        I pulverised them separately and ground them finely on the porphyry as much as I could. Then I mixed all of one with the other and re-ground it on the porphyry. Afterwards I moistened it in paper folded in a moist napkin which is made wet more quickly from the moisture of the night, or the moisture of the cellar. I have never found one which can be removed more cleanly from the mold than this, though it needs to be quite moist. And if you want to cast small works, make it very hot. It came out very cleanly from the doulx tin, like the main one, and has sustained several castings. For tin, I believe that it is not necessary to look further to find a material that takes to powder better, and even for use with fine lead which has almost better results than tinTou. The bone of an ox hoof is always dry, that is why you must mix it with fatty sand, so it will bind like tripoli, salts, felt, ashes and similar materials. If you do not mix ox-hoof bone, it will not turn out from the mold and will not mold cleanly because it crumbles.

    <heading>Ammonia salt and alabaster</heading>
    
    <block>
        Dry ammonia salt, ground  on a marble slab, molds very cleanly and is easily removed from the mold. When mixed with pulverized alabaster, use two ounces per pound of alabaster; it also is easily removed from the mold. It should be humidified in a cellar or in the cool humid evening air, or to have it quickly, in a sheet of paper in a moist towel. Take care not to leave it too long because it will soften, which would not be good if you wanted to use it as a box mold. However you can use it well as a core provided that you dry it gently and away from the fire. Otherwise the heat would make it swell, and push the salt onto the surface, causing lumps. If you want to mold a core,  rub your medal with aspic oil. It is better to use 4 ounces of ammonia salt per pound. Humidify it in a damp place for two or three days, so that the material can be handled without sticking. You will mold very cleanly. Let the mold dry out and reheat it, that way it will get body, and become as hard as stone and when it is like that it is far easier to remove from the mold. If you do not reheat it, it could crumble when removed from the mold because of its thinness. It is the same with a large relief medal. Once you have molded, pulverize the material like before, and moisten it in a damp atmosphere.
        
        
        
        left-middleAll sands which can be removed easily from the mold have body, well-made fat ammonia, and  is sand that removes easily from a mold. There is nothing better for binding than the salt of the metal itself. When ground into powder, they pick up moisture, dry and reheat together.

    <heading>White glassmaker's sand mixed with ammonia salt</heading>

        You can find this sand in Cominge, near the town Aurignac. This sand is dry and as white  as salt. Glassmakers and potters use this sand ground on the porphyry until it becomes as fine as possible. Easy to grind, this sand looks like calcined alabaster, and provides a very clean mold. I have not found another as suitable for delicate bas reliefs. It is also excellent to mold as a core, without any box mold. You must grind it very finely on a porphyry with gummed water or pure water, then apply a thick coat (as thick as mustard or a little bit thicker) over the medal, which has already been lightly rubbed with oil, walnut oil or, even better, aspic oil. For best results, let it dry by itself, away from fire, for one or two days. If you are in a hurry, you can heat it; it should not break if the coat is quite thick. If it is suddenly exposed to fire, some holes will appear; that does not happen if it has been gently dried. Once dry, reheat it, and it should allow for several castings.

But to make it finer, I dry ground it  on the porphyry, then I mixed it with iron dross which was pulverized and ground the same way. Both ingredients take a very clean cast of bas-reliefs, without being moistened with serain, or into the hollow mould, or anywhere else with the serviette, and the cast can be cleanly removed.

    <heading>Every kind of sand can be made useful</heading>
    
    <block>
        Artisans who do big works, and who need to search for things made by nature to pursue their work, because nature does not want to sell its wares to its children, and in order to save the time they would spend grinding, pulverizing and artificially preparing their sand, look for sand from sandpits, which is not too fat from the soil, nor too arid and, consequently, without any binder effect. From deep in the sandpit, one can find some lumps and gravel that show the sand's natural compaction; it is quite hard to break, with very small and fine grains, quite smooth between the fingers. And since it is found solely close to mountainous regions or arid lands, you cannot find any near every good town, where artisans live. Thus, if they can't find any close to their home, they prefer to order some of this sand from afar, like Lyon, Venice or Paris, near the Sainte Chapelle, and similar areas, instead of preparing it themselves. Nonetheless, you can be assured that in all locations, you can make sand from the sandpit
        and will be good and will mold cleanly. Because the sand is coarse and dry, filter it through a sieve. If it is not fine enough, wash it. And when the water has settled a little, pour the soiled water into another pot. The coarse [grains] will quickly fall to the bottom of the first pot. But the sand from the troubled water pot, having settled, will be much finer. If this sand does not bind enough, dry crush it on the porphyry, thus making it impalpable, and it will bind as chalk does.  If you wish you can reheat it, and straight after crush it and blend it with salts, or burned cloth, or felt, or paper ashes, or similar material.

    <heading>Orange trees</heading>
    
    <block>
        In Italy, particularly in the coldest areas like Lombardia, people plant the orange trees inside squared wood planters. The planters are larger at the bottom than at the top. People make handles on each side, where they attach straps in order to carry the planter, like one carries the gout sufferers, because if one used wheels to roll them one would damage the garden's paths. Every two year they remember to open the sides of the planters and meticulously cut and trim the ends of the orange tree's roots, which are dry. Otherwise, the roots find the wood [of the planter] and tighten on it, they double over themselves, the ends dry and the tree dies. Once trimmed, the roots gain new space  to expand, without encountering resistance from the wood of the planter. That is why it is better to join the sides of the planter with screws rather than nails, to avoid shaking the soil when one opens them.

        Any tree that has a large pith will be hard to be graft from, because the cutting is difficult to remove.  If the pith is damaged, the graft will take in an unstraight manner, like with vines of all peach and apricot trees.
        
        
        
        Apricot trees have a very thin bark, and so it is necessary to graft them onto young trees whose own bark is not thick yet, such as the young shoots of prune trees or apricot trees.
        
        
        
        The graft will not take if the cutting gets wet.  It is necessary therefore to graft in serein and mild weather, not too cold and not too windy.
        
        
        
        One must use old wood to graft, if one wants to graft on a tree that is already mature and quite big; because if this is the case, it will compress the cutting, and if the cutting is of young wood, it will not grow properly. But old wood resists the compression of old wood better than the young, because it is harder than young wood. But if the graft is done with only old wood, it will never grow beautifully, but will be frail and short and will take a long time to grow.

    <heading>Molding with cuttlefish bone</heading>
    <block> Pay attention to keep the bones in a dry place, because they are very prone to dampness.
        If you have a small medal, divide the bone into two pieces, then smooth the two parts with a
        knife. And on a dry, smooth rooftile [that has been] pulverized with willow charcoal, rub
        and polish the two half bones. In this way, the bones soak up the willow charcoal so that
        the bones will come off cleanly from the cast, and will not stick to it. Then on a fake
        bone, that is to say a bit of smooth brick of the same width as your bone, place your medal.
        And then on the medal, put your bone and press it firmly with another stone of the same
        size. And for a second time, mold it, and instead smooth over the top with willow charcoal
        and blow slowly, then press as before, and it will cast neatly. If it is for a spoon handle,
        two whole bones are needed. Any work that is cast is brittle and prone to breaking, because
        the metal swells when cast, and contracts and condenses when hammered. That is why it is
        necessary to retrace with a chisel the cast object and in this way the metal will contract
        again and let it escrouir. If the piece you have to cast is in high relief, first trace the
        mold and the hollow with a penknife, to make a clear path for the medal and then cast it.
        And if the medal has two sides </block>
    <block position="left-bottom">Rather than casting, heat the bones only to make them lose the
        coldness and wetness.</block>

    <block> Because the two bones are joined, cut around them with precision, and make notches in
        different places which cross through where the two bones are joined, so as to recognize the
        place where they were first joined. Or with little shards of wood, you can also pierce the
        bones, or coat the joints with clay, and leave it to dry. Compress between them it with your
        two hands in between your knees; and do not use a normal press, otherwise the bones will
        break. Mold at your leisure two or three times, until you can see that it has the design
        come up and is well imprinted. And on each occasion rather than putting the piece straight
        back in the mold, smooth with willow charcoal because it helps it to come out easily. Once
        you have cast, rub your medal with oil and willow charcoal with a brush, to make it dull.
        Take care that your medal is not greasy or oily when you cast it in cuttlefish bone. Once
        you have cast, leave it to cool rather than taking the medal out straight away, because when
        one takes it out hot, some bone will come away with the medal. Cast at medium heat, which
        you will recognize because the bone should stay almost white. But when it is too hot, the
        bone becomes brown. The proportion of lead and tin is equal, one to the other. If the piece
        is difficult to cast, and composed of various pieces, cast it with a forked pattern, of
        three or four grooves, and make and make these grooves where the metal is the thickest. Also
        make these grooves around the medal and directly on the head because this attracts the metal
        and will fill the figure best. Lift your boxmold a little, once you cast, and in this way
        you will be able to make several clean casts. Tin that is too hot burns the bone which
        becomes damaged. Moreover, having come out of the mold hot , it risks breaking. <figure

       And for this effect, one casts a medal of fine tin, which is harder to melt. And since it is neat, one molds with it.  And one leaves it in one half of the box mold, &amp; presses it a little so that it holds better. And next, you shall cast in your box mold the solder described above, or another more meltable than fine tin. And thus, the second medal will melt and mold itself on the first one without ruining it. But to be safer, temper lamp black with water, &amp; with a pinceau, give a light coat of this to the medal, which remains in the box mold, &amp; leave to dry. Thus it will not melt.
        
        But if you have a  medal of copper or silver, you can leave it in the casting, if you want to cast with lead or tin; but it is necessary that it be a little hot, for the cold would make the tin contract.
        
        Tin needs to be cast quite hot to come out neat.

        It can also be frozen, as I tried, that is to say with aqua fortis which before corroded a bit of silver. This, mixed, will make tin and lead fluid.

        Pure tin, frozen mercury, smells like tin. Iced tin, pure lead, as much of one as of the other, makes a substance that  melts very quickly but that is fragile and white. I think that it would be good for soldering. [Takes a] long time to cool.

        Do not use a graft from old wood, because it never makes a beautiful tree.
        
        Leave only two shoots on the graft and no more, otherwise it will become weaker. The wind torments it and leaves it strengthless to propagate by cuttings.
        
        Trees which have big pith, such as peach trees, and all other trees of their kind, and the plum trees, can't be grafted when freezing because the cold damages their pith, which also has to be protected avoiding to cut the bottom of the graft.
        
        All grafts must not be done earlier than the sap flows up, otherwise they dry.

    <heading>Faces painted with distemper</heading>

    <block>

        Because colors painted with distemper dry quickly and one would not have enough time to complete the shadows and touches on the face, one wets the reverse of the face, on canvas, with a wet sponge. Then, with a small pinceau, one makes the shadows, which won't come off. Next, one lays the flesh tones, which do not prevent the already painted shadows from appearing. And then, one retouches the more prominent areas with lively flesh tones. And with another pinceau one retouches the shadows in hatching. The shadow strokes do not come off because they are made of bister, which stains the canvas like rust. The said bister is good for making shadows with distemper, for in oil it has no body and would dry with great difficulty. One mixes ru ochre in the said bister for shadows with a little sap green. The best bister is the rich, shiny one from the fireplaces of large kitchens. It is difficult to grind and screeches on the marble slab.

       Azur desmail always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the used water would makes it die. It always needs to be coated twice, &amp; first very thickly, driving the pinceau by laying it lengthwise then across. It is better used on canvas, which imbibes it immediately, than on wood. Varnish restores its vigor, because while imbibing, it becomes dark. To try it, painters bring their palettes to the grocers and distemper and mix @ it with a bit of white crushed in oil, for in this way the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, while the mediocre is lavender grey. The thinner one is best to work with. It is made thinner by being washed.

    <heading>Burnisher</heading>
    
    <block>
        The different parts of a sword are the handle, [and] the sheath of the sword. What comes next is the heel. The rest is the blade. The sides are the edge and the point. Certain blades, acute in point, have only one side filed in the middle &amp; along the whole length, and are easy to break. Other blades are called of three molds or three grips, which have one good rise in the middle, but this elevation is flat as if it were acute in point but flattened. These ones are most certain. Others are called fluted, which are notched from the middle, &amp; when it is along the whole length, they are just as easy to break as those acute in point and are more troublesome to burnish because the burnishing stick can't get in. But they make one specially that is narrow.
        
        Making up the hilt of the sword are the pommel, the branches of the hilt and the cross-guard, which is this iron strip that closes off the guard [and] that is at the end of the heel to stop thrusts from sliding down the hilt. The rings are these two branches in half round that start from the eye of the guard and go all the way to the branch of the cross-guard.  The branch that crosses the hilt is called the body and this escutcheon, by which the sword enters the sheath and to which all the branches return, and which holds them, is called the eye of the guard.
        
        
        
        Following is the wood of the grip which one glues or more fittingly [uses] some mingled wax which is made of wax and pitch, for rosin would be too hard. He heats it lightly, then rubs the wood of the grip so that the tang takes hold, or the threads, otherwise, when a thread frays off, the whole thing will break all at once. With iron thread or dog skin, one also uses glue. The trimming set on the wood, which is made of silk or thread, is called the cord, which is made from two or three threads twined on the spinning wheel, or 4 if the silk is thin. A cord a little bigger holds better. The rivements, which are also made of silk at both ends of the grip, are called the buttons.
        
        
        
        Some grips are made of silk, seal skin, iron thread reheated with gold and fine and false silver thread &amp; velvet [thread]. Iron thread is of less price and is most durable. Next is that of silk, if one does not have the convenience of being close to the sea in order to recover some dog skin, which is quite convenient. The good skin costs fifty or lx s{ous} and makes 4 or five dozen grips. This one gives a good grip and a sure hand. To put it to work, if it is too hard, soak it for one or two hours in slightly lukewarm aqua fortis. Because if it were too hot, it would boil and spoil the skin. It is sewn with black thread.

        The gold handles are made with some yellow thin cloth set below or other kind of chalk-yellowed fabric. And this cloth is set on with glue or aforesaid gum. This is in order to make the thread hold better on it. These latter are made of cordons like the silk ones and between two cordons are put one or two threads to enhance it. The silver one is identically made. And there is as much difficulty as for the silk one, not because silk is difficult to twisted, but it needs to be twisted twice. A fine gold handle is worth 28 or 20 cents.
        
        The best sword point is of sage foliage.
        
        
        
        This long stick on which the sword is laid down and attached in order to furbish is called the chameau. It is commonly made from rowan which is hard and even.
        
        The stick underneath which is folded bow-like is called the arch.
        
        The stick above is called stick of the fustÃ©e.
        
        And this square piece, used on the sword to burnish it, is called the fustÃ©e.
        
        There are two horns, one is called the oil hornet and the other the emery hornet. 
        
        There is an iron tool with the shape of a halberd point, square and made of very even and well limed steel called the grateau which helps to soften lime strokes on swords hilts and to sharpen blades once they are softened which is better than with stone or other tools which leave some scratches.
        
        To make the swords cut better, the edge from the point is also sharpened.
        
        Those who create sword hilts are different craftsmen than furbishers.
        
        The fustÃ©e is a three-finger-thick, square wood tool, made of boxwood which fit in the middle of the fustÃ©e stick to furbish.
        
        The fresil stick is made of willow wood which is to [â€¦] weapon with some clinker which is the iron scale falling from the blacksmiths' forge.

        The furbisher buys his blades by the dozen which are not finished, [but ready] to be pulled from [their] sheaths since he does this himself in order to add them well at the pommels and guards.
        
        
        
        Spanish swords are esteemed to be better for they are of better steel and iron but they are not as well-forged as Vienna swords, in DauphinÃ©. The Spanish ones are not as well sharpened from the forge since they sharpen them with their feet and this is what makes them wavy.
        
        
        
        Vienna blades cost commonly Xviii or 19 lb.
        
        
        
        The first thing the furbisher does to his new blades is to draw them out from the sheath, which he does himself or has it done by locksmiths or blacksmiths to whom he gives some liart for their charcoal. Afterwards they pass it over a grindstone to cut it down. Then they lay it down on the chameau, and with some powdered emery, fine and soft as flour, and soaked with oil to make it take, they polish the sword with the stick used to take off the tracks left by the grindstone and then they clean the blade well with the emery. And they add a drop or two of oil spread with the finger to give it luster. Once the oil is applied, they polish it again on the chameau with the "felin" which is a thunderstone mounted on the middle of a stick like the "fustÃ©e." And this stick is called the "felindel" stick. Once they used the "felin," they polish it again with some chalk and the oil [already] on the sword. After they follow this and going over it again, they polish it with dry chalk. Finally when they are finished with mounting [of the pommel and guard], they give it a sharp edge with a file. They then dry it and sharpen it and furbish it again with some dry chalk. At the end when they are completed and mounted, they give it [the blade] a sharp edge with a grater.
        
        
        
        They are polished on a false mounting with the guards which are present in order to find out if they work well together. And employing a blade of the sort of which all the sizes should be made in the hand, one conjectures whether it will be as strong when mounted.
        
        
        
        One puts the blade in a vice between two pieces of wood, then with a file, they enlarge [it] if needed for attaching the guard. Then to clench it, one positions the place to be riveted and the pommel on a piece of wood. And with a hammer, one beats on the top to make it very level and to secure the pommel. Then with the hammer, one finishes the rivet when the hammer is well secured and does not shake. The wood is placed so as not to put gashes in the pommel. Afterwards one makes a place for the rivet with a file or chisel. And some make the rivet [or attachment] in a diamond-shape but this is not as good as a round [topped one] because one cuts oneself on the corner of the rivet.

        The end can be bought already made, a dozen of small ones costs six sols but the big ones 2 carolii.The end is fixed either with nails which are fixed on the sides of the cutting edge, but this only spoils the sword and rots the scabbard for the water goes into it via the juncture of the nail. The best way is to apply some resin or glue but the resin is better. And the best is when the end is tightly set and so hot when set that powdered resin on the end melts, in that way it doesn't fall and can't be undone unless it is put in fire.
        
        Hilts are of different types:
        
        Ornate
        
        Guttered which is with round mouldings
        
        Pearled
        
        Scarfed when the bands are crosswise
        
        Onioned which is with a flat head
        
        In the King's manner, fully covered 
        
        The furbishers buy them by dozens, the dozen of full ones costs 10 lb. the worked one, 30 sols or [more] depending on its nature.
        
        
        
        The first thing that the apprentice does is to furbish as said.
        
        And then to adorn the sword and make a scabbard which is the summum of the art.
        
        They buy scabbards' wood pieces which are wholly made of beech wood, a hundred for 15 or 20 or 30 sols, depending on how far they are made.
        
        Theses wood pieces are thus called estelles, and have to be very clean and without any knots and are one finger thick.
        
        Then the furbisher puts them on a small bench, called a scabbard bench and with a small iron tool similar to the joiners' bench, they maintain it firmly.  Then with a plane, which is like a two-handled knife, they work the wood piece from the top, then use the joyner's plane to flatten it more. Afterwards, the inside is scoured with a

So if you want to mold a thick piece in <material>tin</material>, mold it only one one side, and if it is possible, make it hollow on the other side. In this way your piece will be neater. And then you can solder two half pieces together. But if you have no choice but to mold it thick, make the shape of it and mold <foreign language="French">force abreuvouers</foreign> around the figure in this way.</block>

<block><activity type="gardening"/>To graft, it is necessary to take the new growth that was produced within the year by the <plant>tree</plant> you wish to graft. And cut off a branch in which you can see that beside the place where the leaves join the stem, there are little buttons we call buds, the initial stages of a sprout. With dexterity you must, with a very sharp <tool>pen-knife</tool>, cut in the shape of a graft a small bit of the skin of the <plant>tree</plant>, which contains a bud or a sprout with the leaf, as you can see in B. Then on the tender <material>wood</material>, which is full of <material>sap</material>, and on which you wish to graft, cut quickly two lines as you can see , then add in the middle a slit thusly.<figure identifier="fig_p105r_2" url="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5T1FZYTdOT1U4Qzg" position="right-bottom"/> Then with the point of your <tool>pen-knife</tool> separate the bark from the <plant>tree</plant>, and open it from the slit in the middle, and having neatly lodged your graft so that nothing is sticking out, only the sprout, binding everything well and wrap the whole thing with a bit of <tool>linen</tool> or <tool>soft string</tool>. In this way, there will be nothing uncovered but the leaf, which in three or 4 <time>days</time> will indicate whether the graft has taken hold, by being green. Keep your graft in this way for seven or eight <time>days</time>. Then unwrap it, and join it to the bark, keeping the sprout itself straight, and then rewrap the whole thing gently, but not as strongly as before.

Therefore make sure the back is in tact. This type of grafting can be done from <time>mid-May</time> onwards, because the <plant>trees</plant> have budded and made new growth, until the beginning of <time>August</time> when the <plant>trees</plant> are full of <material>sap</material>. <plant>Almond trees</plant> which are naturally drier lose their <material>sap</material> earlier.

<heading>Making <material>gold</material> run for casting</heading>

<block><activity type="casting"/>Because <material>gold</material> cools down very quickly, you have to give it a mixture when it is well melted that will keep the heat. <material>Sublimate</material> softens it nicely. But, since it vanishes into <material>smoke</material>, it won't aid you for very long. Therefore mix this mixture into it when you want to cast it: of <material>sal ammoniac</material>, the best <material>verdigris</material> that you can find, a bit of <material>borax</material> and some <material>saltpeter</material>. And this, held over the heat, will become neat. The <material>saltpeter</material> makes it clear and heats it. But the key thing in this mixture is the <material>verdigris</material>, which has to be good. This mixture softens your <material>gold</material> so much that it becomes as tractable as <material>lead</material>, even if it is good <material>gold</material>.</block>

<material>Spalt</material> is white like <material>cooked plaster</material> and one can find it in mounds and <material>stones</material> made in long stairs and long veins. It is very soft such that with a fingernail and it makes a powder like that of our <material>chalk from Champagne</material>. And because everything which is provided from the earth is mixed with some other substance, to purify it [the spalt], one boils it with somewhat large <material>gemstones</material> then tempers it with <material>essence of sal ammoniac</material>. One puts [a lump of it] <unit>the size of a walnut</unit> in a large <tool>bottle</tool> of <material>water</material> and <folio number="108v" url="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f222.image"/>that way one tempers it &amp; reducing it into small balls, [one] purges it of impurities [by] then putting it on to cook cleanly in a <tool>vessel of earth[enware]</tool> in a <tool>furnace</tool> like those in which <tool>pots</tool> [are made] and one leaves it there to the point at which <tool>pots</tool> would be fired.

And one does this therefore until that which is there has passed away. In this way one purges and purifies and makes it a very fine and malleable [matter]. After one has taken away the <material>water</material> by tilting [it] or with a <tool>sponge</tool>, one takes the residue and dries it. Then moistening it with the aforementioned <material>water</material> the way one did with the other <material>sand</material>, one uses it in a <tool>frame</tool> or if it shrinks [this] is a sign that it is not fired enough &amp; needs to be fired more. This one is proper for molding all <material>metal</material> and especially <material>gold</material> and <material>silver</material> and the more it is used the better it is. One should put <material>alum</material> which you have cast of <material>lead</material> or <material>tin</material> separately because it makes <material>gold</material>. sour if you cast it there.

<heading>Second Casting</heading>

    <block><activity type="casting"/>When you have well molded the first part of the <animal>animal</animal>, that is to say the back, the spine, and the entire top part, and when the half-mold where the part is encased is hard enough <figure identifier="fig_114r_2" url="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5SWVndzB0aEk5MWs" position="left-top"/> turn over the bottom and the sides of the belly, sometimes using a <tool>knife</tool> for the thicker parts, and then with a <tool>pen-knife</tool> for the places where the more fragile parts are encased, like legs, tail, and similar things. Because the head is higher, you will have to dig deeper to expose it and do a deeper notch that has to be well exposed, by enlarging it from the outside, in order for the second mold that you cast on top of it releases well. A process for which the <animal>animal</animal> himself can be useful because his nature so permits. However, make sure that you reveal the <animal>lizard's</animal> throat more than you would do a <animal>snake</animal>, because the <animal>lizard</animal> has big jaws and big bones that do not cast as easily, and has deep ears in which the <material>wet sand</material> is not as easy to remove. But you will avoid all of this if you expose half of the head and those things that you know do not release easily. When everything is well exposed, blow over it and wipe each part again with a <tool>cloth made of swine hair</tool>, slightly dampened into <material>salt water</material> or <material>clear water</material>, do that gently, that way the lower part of your uncovered <animal>animal</animal> will be very neat. # <material>🝋</material> Once it is done, dip the covered side of your mold into <material>water</material> for a <foreign language="Latin">pater noster</foreign>. It will suck <material>water</material> inside, that way when you'll rub with <material>oil</material> the uncovered side, the <material>oil</material> will remain on the top, and to prevent the second cast which you will cast on top from sticking. Dip your mold into <material>water</material>, take a particularly <tool>fine brush</tool> and rub with <material>oil</material> the entire mold but the <animal>animal</animal>; it should not be touched with <material>oil</material>. Make sure to use you brush between the parts and on all the fragile parts.

<block>This thus prepared, put your first half-mold on the disc of <material>clay</material>, surround it with a <material>clay</material> circle and do a thickness mark similar to the first one. Then, with a rather <tool>thick brush</tool>, wet with <material>spirits</material> all your <animal>animal's</animal> exposed half, without, if possible, missing any part, because therein lies the secret to casting neatly. Then, as fast as possible before the <material>spirits</material> evaporate, soak your <material>sand</material>, and cast it, shaking, blowing, and moving the mold, as you did for the first one, making sure that what you pour first on the <animal>animal</animal> is clearer than the rest, so that it is soaked everywhere and highlights the finer parts. So, leave it for fifteen <unit>minutes</unit> so it sets, then remove the <material>clay</material> circle and disc. And, with a <tool>knife</tool>, join you two molds together in a longish form, like a mandore, as we say, because of how you cast. Then soak a little in <material>water</material> the whole mold up to the level of the joints. Because this is another secret to separate them more easily. Otherwise, you would break everything. Separate them like this skillfully. After this, gently and patiently remove half of the <animal>animal</animal> still in the mold, pulling it sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other, in order to avoid breaking it, or ruining parts of the mold. The mold, being empty, rejoin both half so that no <material>dust</material> comes in, and put them aside until you want to heat them up, make the <tool>runners</tool>, the <tool>vents</tool> and put the <tool>clamps</tool>.

I believe that it would be better preserved in <material>spirits</material>. However, it would be best to make the 4 or 5 molds the same day because these <animal>animals</animal> rot and will smell within the <unit>day</unit>.

<block position="left-top">If after both halfs of the <foreign language="French">noyau</foreign> have set and hardened, it would not open if you did not dip it into <material>water</material>.

<block position="left-middle">However, be sure that your second mold is thick enough, and hard enough otherwise it could break while dipping it into <material>water</material> if you want to open it.

    <heading> Molding a crab</heading>
<purpose type="making"/>
    <purpose type="advice"/>
    <activity type="casting animals"/>
    <block> It is a secret and a masterpiece to mold [a crab] well because it is necessary to
        proceed differently [than you would] with other animals, because its shell is quite
        difficult to [...] and that is why it is necessary to reheat the mold three or four times.
        And on top of all that, it leaves a hard crust [that is] gray like ash. It is not molded
        from one piece and one cast as [is done with] plants. Rather, [it is moulded] in two casts
        as [is done] with <animal>serpents</animal> which are easily stripped from it [the mold].
        After it is opened, nimbly remove this crust with the very fine point of a
            <tool>pen-knife</tool> {and not with <tool>quicksilver</tool> which removes nothing from
        it} and likewise those small crusts of the second cast which get into the cavities that the
        sand or the molded animal made because it has curved legs. Here is the subtlety and the
        secret of stripping it. As you molded it [the crab] from the back side in the way [that you
        did for] the others [animals], remove the stomach and all the curved legs from it. Make your
        second cast in the way [that you did for] the other [animals], but as it will have set, take
        care that you not open the mold unless you have first reheated it well. Otherwise, because
        of its curved legs, you would break the whole thing. Herein lies the subtlety. If, after it
        has been well reheated and opened, you see that the crust is not burned enough, reheat [it]
        until it is burned [enough]. </block>

        tin. When you are going to cast, add a piece of resin to your mixture, then a little
        looking-glass tin. If you add too much lead to your tin, the mixture wouldn't be fluid

    <block> Light your charcoals from the forge, then place them in a line in a corner of the forge
        according to the size of your mold, in order that it be surrounded with 3 or 4 fingers of
        charcoals, particularly at the bottom of the mole, where it is thicker. Then put your molds
        on these charcoals -- and not on a grate as some people do -- because they would get too
        strong a heat. Let your furnace heat up gradually for a while, always adding burning
        charcoal. As long as the mold is humid, your charcoal will be dampened at the bottom, but
        when it is dry, the charcoals start to blaze. When one side of the mold is dry, turn over;
        when both sides are dry and don't smoke anymore, increase the heat and cover your mold with
        burning coals. When the mold starts being red, do not blow on it with small bellows, because
        the mold would burst. Similarly, when your mold becomes red-hot, keep it well covered with
        burning charcoals and do not uncover it because it would crack. Prevent the draft from a
        window from reaching it. Then let it cool down. </block>
    <block position="left-middle">When you want to anneal your molds, luted or not, do mark the
        belly of your mold, in order to place that side at the bottom, against the burning

        it do so on the bottom part instead of the top part. </block>

        cereal, which is doulx and apt for the cast. Some people say that <tool>counter</tool> from
            <place>Germany</place> contain a lot of <material>calamine</material>. However, when
        they are tempered, <material>calamine</material> evaporates, <material>calamine</material>
        mixed with melted <material>latten</material> always evaporates, because
            <material>latten</material> becomes red again, thanks to the reiteration of melting.
        However, fresh <material>calamine</material> and only fresh <material>calamine</material>,
        which is blended with remelted <material>latten</material>, makes
            <material>latten</material> run, and allow a clean cast. Because
            <material>calamine</material> which is added to remelted <material>latten</material> is
        half-damaged compared with its natural state. This half-damaged
            <material>calamine</material> make <material>latten</material> porous and agitated
        because it has a tendency to evaporate. Thus add only very fresh
            <material>calamine</material> to melted <material>latten</material>. Make sure to cast
        your mold very hot, you mold must become red-hot, like molds to cast
            <material>gold</material>, <material>silver</material>, <material>copper</material> and
        metal. If you pour fresh <material>calamine</material>, avoid its smoke which is pernicious.
        To cast a medal, I took thirty <material>counters</material> from <place>Germany</place> and
        xii <material>clous de rosette</material> made of <material>doulx latton</material>, like
        for claires medals which are made of soft <material>latten</material>. This matter contains
        a lot of <material>calamine</material> like all kind of yellow <material>latten</material>,
        and make a lot of smoke which prevent <material>latten</material> from running, and make it
        porous, that is why it is necessary to make many vents and to cast very hot, latten must be
        as white as water, or as melted <material>silver</material> or as a polished mirror of
        steel. The second fusion will come out much better because evaporated
            <material>calamine</material> does not make as much smoke. If you use a molding frame
        that does not break and holds its own, the second [casting] will come more neatly out of the
        mold, because the frame is impregnated with the smoke of <material>calamine</material>. If
        you add <material>sal ammoniac</material> to your <material>latten</material>, this latten
        will be clear and shiny, but will be even more shiny with <material>huile
            tingente</material>. Do not use another <material>sand</material> than the above
        mentioned to mold a <material>noyau</material>, and the mold must become red-hot, like a
        mold to cast <material>gold</material>. Make a lot of vents. If you cast yellow
            <material>latten</material> with the prepared tutty you will not get any smoke. </block>

    <heading>Wetting sand to mold flat medals</heading>
    <purpose type="making"/>
    <activity type="casting"/>
    
    <block> Flat medals, made of <material>wax</material> or metal, must be oiled very lightly and then touched with a
        brush of <material>spirits</material>. So that the already moistened mold takes well the oiled thing without
        rejecting it, one warms the water well in order to wet the <material>sand</material>, because with cold water it
        would be rejected. It is necessary to <material>oil</material> medals, because they do not expand and in this way
        would break the mold. Animals, which expand, do not need oiling. The hot water much be of
        such a heat that you cannot keep your figure in it without it becoming too warm. Wet the
        thickest sand for flat and solid medals rather than [for] <animal>lizards</animal> and finer things. Once
        your <material>sand</material> has set, clean and scrape your mold on one side and the other, and on the bottom
        edge of the thrown side of the medal, make a notch so that it is easier to take out. Lower
        the mold, scraping what surrounds the medal, so that on all sides you can take it out easily
        without it damaging the mold. Then make some gashes around the first mold used to throw so
        that the second time that you throw in it, it will be identical to the first one, and in the
        same way, make a notch at the bottom of the mold, where the held of the item cast lies. Also
        make some [gashes] in the sides of the cast. This done, wet the back of the first mold in
        oiled water, and after the second casting moisten it with warm water if you have molded your
        medal in a <material>noyau</material> mold. Having done the first cast, and this one having set, cut around the
        edge of the medal with the point of a knife so that it comes out of the throw and is not
        buried in it. Then having made the second cast, and having opened your mold, take away the
        medal in one go, with two <tool>knife</tool> points, one on the side of the cast object and one on the
        side of the head, which is at the opposite end. </block>
    <block position="left-middle">Take care not to <material>oil</material> your medal too much because if the seeps out,
        it prevents the sand from serving its purpose and coming together and renders it wavy and
        lumpy. You must only touch the middle of the medal with the tip of your oil brush and then
        smear the oil everywhere. </block>

    <block position="left-bottom"> Make especially sure that the throw is as wide as you can on the
        medal and holds it together well. The gate of your cast must always be big and always
        narrowing as you go towards the medal. Also do not forget to notch the gate of your cast. </block>

    <folio number="138r" url="http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10500001g/f281.image"/>
    <block> If you want to cast <material>gold</material>, <material>silver</material>, <material>copper</material> or brass, it is necessary that they be
        perfectly red, and fired on the inside when you cast, and perfectly reheated twice, if there
        is something inside to be burnt and cleaned. </block>
    <block> The molds of animals that you burn must be reheated in such a manner that the animal
        burns up. But if it has big bones, it is frustrating to take out and ☿ often breaks delicate
        things because of its heaviness. One does not put ☿in molds that can open. It is often molds
        for flowers that do not open because they are cast in one go. </block>
    <block> When you want to reheat your molds, fix <tool>cramp-irons</tool> on the joints, so that when they
        reheat they will not bend, contract or break. This is done once the cast is made. </block>
    <block> The scrapings of the mold can also be used instead of bricks after being reheated, and
        also the leftover bits of the mold that have already been used. You can also pat it over
        important things, like works in gold or silver. You can also reheat it and blend it with
        water diluted with <material>sal ammoniac</material>, like <material>spar</material> from <place>Germany</place>, and is excellent <material>sand</material> for box molds
        for all metals. </block>
    <block> The molds with things that need to be burnt out inside them, those ones will not open
        until the thing that is inside is burnt, like the molds for <animal>crayfish</animal>, <animal>crab</animal>, <animal>great-horned
            beetles</animal>. Do not open the molds in which you will burn something, not before the thing is
        burnt, it could be crayfishes, crabs, stag beetles, pictures, and pieces of <material>wax</material> and <material>black
            sulphur</material>, which do not come out of the mold [easily]. </block>
    <block> You must not mold on <material>brick</material> or <material>wood</material> because they absorb and attract water too early, and
        do not allow the sand to set. The best place for [the sand] is on a fresh layers of <material>clay</material>.
        And yet, I have experienced that <material>grey earth</material> dries out the mold too quickly. <material>Yellow [earth]</material>
        is better. </block>
    <block position="left-middle">For medals, and flat things, the sand must be quite thick and
        moistened so that it sets quickly. And when the sand is thusly thick, you can shake and move
        the table where you mold lies, so that [the movement] makes the <material>sand</material> go everywhere. But when
        the sand is clear, as for flowers and herbs, you cannot shake it, nor can you do it when
        there is something attached to wax or other things which are prone to come off, such as the
        legs of <animal>crayfish</animal> or other similar things. And if by chance your sand is too thick, you must
        quickly add some water. And having put the sand in the water, examine it until it is thick
        on the bottom and clear on top. The clearest is thrown in immediately and then bubbles and
        the thickest is thrown in at the end so that it strengthens the mold. </block>

        it to cool until you can put your finger in it without causing a breach in the gate of the
        cast. As for the <material>lead</material>, it is melted in a <tool>crucible</tool> with a
        bellows' fire until both the <tool>crucible</tool> and the <material>lead</material> are
        red. When it gets to that state, cleanse it anew with <material>charcoal</material> or with
        a specially made <tool>scraper</tool> or with the pufts of the little bellows. This done,
        leave it to rest in it red state and you can even reheat it, then if you want, throw in a
        bit of <material>resin</material> to burn away the filth. However, some think it best not to
        put any in because it leaves filth. But when they are ready to cast, they cannot forget to
        also thrown in a bean-size quantity of <material>bismuth</material> for each pound of
            <material>lead</material>. And it must be as red as the melted metal when it enters the
        mold. If the mold is large, it is much better to put in in a <tool>press</tool> so that they
        join well and so that the <material>lead</material> does not come out of the mold. However,
        should this happen, and that for the first, second or third time your mold does not fill up,
        cast heartily because for as long as your metal is red it will mix and join with the other
        one and will come out very neatly like the main one. The same thing can be said for pure
            <material>tin</material> used for thin things. And that way for doing pure
            <material>tin</material> is one <unit>℥</unit> of new <material>lead</material> for one
            <unit>lb</unit>. of the former. Large molds must be put in a press held tightly between
        two <tool>layers of copper</tool>, and then bury the whole thing in
            <material>sand</material>, which is better than ashes, because being heavy, it will seal
        better. Otherwise large molds are prone to open because the metal is heavy. Some make square

            Take some <material>white wax</material> which is much more
            appropriate for this kind of work than anything else, because it is much firmer and does
            not leave as much filth, as much as you need to cast the animal that you propose, and no
            more. And [take] a half quantity of ground <material>coal</material> and neatly sieved
            through a <tool>cloth</tool> or <tool>coal sleeve</tool>, using it to give some color to your <material>wax</material>,
            that would otherwise be transparent and you will not be able to see your lines as
            clearly. Put your <material>wax</material> on the coal fire to melt. And when it is well-melted and
            well-liquified, have, for a full <tool>eared-porringer</tool> of melted wax, as much
                <material>sulphur</material> as a large walnut. Pulverize it. Melt it over a slow
            fire and when it is melted, do not leave it on the fire because it will become too hard.
            But take it off and keep stirring it with a little stick and when it has finished
            bubbling and is as liquified as water, cast it into the wax that you will have
            previously removed from the fire. And mix and stir both of the them so that they join
            together. After stir in little by little while continuously mixing, the charcoal that
            has been repeatedly ground, and in this way it will be very well incorporated. This is
            how you will know that your wax has gone beyond its ideal heating point, it will release
            no more smoke, it will start to have lines appearing on the side and not in the middle,
            and those lines will be close to each other. If you cast too hot, you will not be able
            to separate your <material>wax</material> from your mold and it would stick to the cast. When it is at the
            right state, stir it with a little stick so that the pulverized
                <material>charcoal</material> is well mixed in and has not fallen to the bottom of
            the mixture. And in this way, throw it in your mold bit by bit and not in one go,

            can cast two or three times until your mold is full. Now, concerning this mold of
            pulverized <material>white plaster</material> &amp; reheated in the manner of the <material>sand</material>
            from the preceding recipes, you should have made it long ago because it is used many
            times. But, before using it, soak it for a good hour in cold water, &amp; at a minimum,
            at least as long in hot water that at first is so hot that you can't hold your finger in
            it. And note that it absorbs no more, but that it appears very wet overall without water
            seeping into it. In removing it closed from the hot water, cast your <material>wax</material> in such a state
            of heat as has been described. And neither the first nor the second casting will readily
            come out well, hardly, until the mold is soaked. Let it cool down before opening it so

            as large as other molds. And if, in the first casting, your work fills with bubbles and
            in so doing does not come out neatly, it's all the same, because you have to face the
            fact that the three or four first do not readily come out well. Firstly, you will know
            whether there are a few barbs that keep it from stripping well. And you will remove them
            if, on their own, they do not remove themselves in the two or three first castings. And
            the more that you cast, the more you will do it neatly. And your mold will serve you

            or one day before casting so that it be well soaked. The same must be done for fruits

            it is hard [this is] because of <material>sulfur</material>, which makes it melt more
            easily than than other [wax], so much that you can see evidence on a hot slate. And the
            <material>sulfur</material> that you put inside will be found the second time that you melt it, [as] cracks
            on the bottom. Having in this way passed through wax, it will not catch fire at all when
            put to a candle. And in this case, I believe that it will cast quite the medal
            [illegible]. One uses the same wax in place of varnish to [illegible]. </block>

    <block purpose="making"> The <animal>crayfish</animal> is one of the most fantastical to cast,
        but also <!-- <activity type="reference"> -->provides an example for casting
            other difficult things<!-- </activity>  -->. You can distinguish males and female by the eggs that
        the females carry, and by the four little white back legs that males have in their tails
        after behind main eight legs. It is good to dry them out a bit so that the bumps come out
        more hard and beautiful, because none of what is made of shell shrinks. It is true that
        should you dry the little inside legs for too long, they become diminished and have no body.
        If they are too dry, the flesh separates from the scales. Be sure then to maintain the mean.
        They have certain hairs between the legs and at the end of the tail. And because all hair is
        difficult to cast, because it gets mixed up in the sand and does not release, you can burn
        it by putting a <tool>hot iron</tool> on the <animal>crayfish</animal> so that it the hair cannot be seen. As
        for animals that have hair or feathers, you must grease the hair with <material>wheat
            oil</material>, which is very dry and which will make the hair lay flat and straight. In
        this way, you will have form of your animal and you will have the hair. Should it the hair
        be wavy, it can be repaired. If your crayfish has eggs, which are delicate, and which will
        be difficult to take out of the mold without breaking, you would do better to make the first
        cast with the crayfish on its belly and eggs. In this way, you will open the mold with it
        the <animal>crayfish</animal> on its back, which will be hard and easy to manipulate. And the belly and the
        eggs will remain in the mold. And rather than opening your mold for the second time, you
        will have to burn it with them in it. This way, it will open easily, and what has been
        burned will come away cleanly. In this way, the second casting, which is done on the first
        one that has successfully taken hold, separates easily from the first, after having been
        refired. This is a singular secret for similar moldings. </block>

        them out, you could break something of the mold. Having uncovered it with the point of a

        And do your second casting after having made the first mold even, so that the cramp-irons
        join better. Your mold must be larger on the side with the impression than on the back. Do
        not open your mold after the second casting, so that it not become clayed &amp; reheated

        easilyfrom the mold. Choose the biggest and the lumpiest <animal>toads</animal>. Because they contain a lot
        of metal, it is best to mold them hollow, since they turn out better. You could make your
        cast in one great piece, but it would be troublesome to cut. It is best to do it in three or
        4 parts, which will be thicker close to the animal, and include the most amount of edge that
        is close to the cast/mold. Make as well some casting conduits all the way from the end of
        the cast,</block>

        due to the aforesaid casting conduits, which you will start in the waxless round parts that

        casting in <material>wax</material>, there is no danger chipping any part of the molded animal. It's quicker to
        make the wax casting conduits thus, because in this way you can cast the second mold after
        the first, rather than wait to do them the conduits after the mold has been recooked,
        because then, if possible, you will need to have everything ready. You need to heat well,

<heading>Mercury in molds, for cleaning</heading>

<block><purpose type="making">Take heed that your mold be quite cold when you blow in order to get the ashes out. And afterwards put in <material>☿</material> in order to finish the cleaning. Because if the mold is hot, the <material>☿</material> will go inside; seek out the conduits in escaping, will leave its own odor, which will aggravate the tin or other metal that you will cast, such that it will break in touching the mold at all. The heat of the mold also retains some little grains of <material>☿</material> that will make lumps; stick to the sides of the molded leaves and attach to them; make them frangible. The <material>☿</material> cleans ashes well. Likewise flat things where there are not delicate traces that it could break with its weight. And therefore, if you can cast neatly without putting it in, don't use it at all. But if you have need of it, mix your <material>crocum sand</material> so that it withstands fire well. And after having put in the <material>☿</material>, evacuate it, bouncing the end of the mold from below while moving it. Afterwards reheat your mold gently so that the <material>☿</material> is gone from everywhere. In this way I cast a branch of periwinkle leaves; flowers very neatly.

This is why you mold in two halves: so that once the mold is opened after having been refired, the thing you've burnt can be cleaned out. <purpose type="advice">But I advise letting it cool so that in taking off the clamps (being hot) nothing cracks while it is still fragile. While it is hot the crust and cinders which it leaves and which stick to the mold can be more easily removed when it is cold. Also note that on the side of the lower mold when you reheat the animal, which in boiling leaves a crust, in this case, always mark on the mold where the back of the animal is so that in reheating it is to the top and above and will by this method stay cleaner.</purpose></block>

<block><material>Mortars</material> are made of the best alloy of <material>"métal"</material> and the finest possible <material>rosette</material> so that they do not burst, that is to say one part "métal" and two [parts] fine rosette or <material>old caudron</material>, which is even better. Some of them are of <unit>fifteen or seventeen lb.</unit> and are loaded with <unit>two and a half lb.</unit> of <material>grain powder</material>, and they are put on common windows and doors. Others are of a weight of <unit>25 to 27 lb.</unit> and are loaded with <unit>eight lb.</unit> of <material>powder</material>. And in such a way, they are made according to the stress they have to resist. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the inside, they are made like a crucible</block>

<block>narrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of <material>powder</material> they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of <unit>4 s. lb.</unit> are eight lines thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 lines. They have <unit>xiii "poulsses"</unit> long and <unit>seven in diameter</unit> at the mouth and opening.</block>

<folio

<block>The ones weighing about <unit>27 lb.</unit> are <unit>ix "pousses" long</unit> and the mouth is <unit>6 [pousses]</unit> in diameter. At their bottom, they are <unit>6 "lignes"</unit> thick, and <unit>3</unit>for the mouth. The ones weighing <unit>17 lb</unit> are <unit>8 "poulsses"</unit> long and the mouth is <unit>five</unit>. They are all covered together, all the <material>forks</material>, <material>rods</material>, and tools which one uses, with a big <tool>canvas</tool> or big <tool>cloth</tool> so that they do not make any noise. It is good that they sit loaded for a while. After the <material>powder</material> has been put in, it is grinded very hard and then tightly pressed paper is put in, then a cake of well pressed <material>wax</material> and, on the wax, another slab of <material>cork</material> that fits in very snugly and that you have to force in. In this way, the powder remains well packed and gives much greater force, and if you wish, you can put on the cork slab one of <material>wood</material> pierced in the middle, if the mortar has a pierced bottom, which is believed to be the easiest and which makes a greater hole because it cannot recoil. And for these that have a pierced bottom, one must have a good gimlet to first make the hole so that the rod, which is made by the point of the gimlet, has before and without noise attached the mortar. And for these, one must cover the button, which is quite sharply filed, with waxed canvas, or add <material>wax</material> to it so that it completely plugs the hole in the bottom. But because the doors are sometimes iron and the <material>iron rods</material> cannot pierce it, an iron fork made like pincers and another iron stick made with three claws, like you see painted, are use. And in this way, the mortar stays in place well and is immediately steadied. The iron rods must come out of the mortar from every point made by the gimlet, namely by <unit>three or 4 finger lengths</unit>, which all enter in the door. When the mortars are placed, the touch-hole is filled with good powder and inserted in it is a feather shaft filled with tightly pressed powder and moistened with <material>vinegar</material>, or if needed, the powder is firmly pressed with the palms of the hands and, having wet it with some saliva, you shape it like a cocoon or</block>

<block>rod that we put into the touch-hole, and then, with a <material>rope</material> wrapped around the end of a <material>baston</material>, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take cover. The small mortars of <unit>16 or 17 lb.</unit> are attached promptly with a short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of <unit>27 lb.</unit>, but then we only put <unit>three lb.</unit> of powder. The door really needs to be strong so as not to be blown off for <unit>seventeenth lb.</unit> mortars. Some people use little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others load two canons of <material>guns</material> and, with a <material>gimlet</material> and a string, tie them with the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.</block>

<block><purpose type="making">You must firstly mold it with <material>plaster</material> as has been said before, and in the <material>plaster</material> throw in some <material>wax</material> from which will come a relief that you will repair very neatly, and will shape at your pleasure.

Dip it in <material>hot urine</material>, and once it is softened enough, make an imprint with it on your <material>half figure in lead</material>.  And you will have a very neat hollow mold.  Then adapt your wax hollow mold into a square shape, as it pleases you, as long as you have sufficient thickness, and make sure it is well even on all sides, and then mold this hollow wax; and having it imprinted on one side, and having it flat and even on the other, in the same way that you would mold a flat medal in wax or metal in a <material>noyau</material>.  And the <material type="foreign_word">noyau</material> mold will give you, whether in <material>silver</material> or any other metal you wish, a figure similar to the wax one, which is to say, flat and even on one side, and hollow on the other.
