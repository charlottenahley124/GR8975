<heading>Excellent <material>sand</material></heading>

<block>
Burn <material>alabaster</material> in a <tool>crusol</tool> under charcoal fire until it turns into powder. Once it is cold, finely pulverise it through a <tool>sieve</tool> to make it impalpable. With a pound of <material>alabaster</material>, one should use an ounce of <material>sal ammoniac</material>. Mix well and incorporate everything together. Next, put it in a cave or a wet location. And with this paste, mold whatever you need and then dry the mold under a fire. While the <material>sand</material> is hot, you cast whatever metal you may like and your cast will be as neat as the principal. And the sand will always work if it is kept in a wet location and dried by the fire.
