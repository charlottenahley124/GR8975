    <heading><material>Sand</material> of <place>Toulouse</place></heading>

    <block>
      The <material>sand</material> generally considered good is the one found in a vineyard near <place>Pech-David</place>. But the best is the one is from the <place>Touch</place>, a river close to <place>Saint-Michel</place> and <place>Blagnac</place>, in a vineyard at a high altitude. This sand is thinner, and a bit greasier than the other, and better for small works. It should not be overheated.
