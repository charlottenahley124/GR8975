<block><material>Tiles</material> with which one covers houses, the hardest and surest and recleaned of <material>stones</material> &amp; large <material>gravel</material>, are taken to mix in with the <material>sand</material> for molding. But, rather, it is necessary to reheat them just until they have been quite red for one or two <time>hours</time>, and crush them and pass them finely through a <tool>sieve</tool>.</block>
