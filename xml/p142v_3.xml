Lute for <activity>luting</activity> your molds
</heading>

<block purpose="making">I have not found a lute that is made more quickly than this one, nor a better one. Take some of the <material>lean earth that artillery founders and bell founders use to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy</material>.  Soak it moderately like a very thick mortar. Mix into it about one half of <material>horse manure</material> and then beat it well.  Afterwards mix in one third of <material>cloth waste or cloth shavings</material> and beat it again quite strongly.  You can reheat your mold as soon as the lute is ready.
