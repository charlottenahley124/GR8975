<heading>Positioning animals</heading>

<block>Not only with <material>iron pins</material>, but also with <material>melted wax</material>, are animals secured to the <tool>plate of earth</tool>. Wash them first in clear water, after they have died in the mixture of <material>vinegar</material> and <material>urine</material>. And with a <tool>sponge </tool>clean off their mouth, eyes and head of the froth coming out, because the <material>sand</material> would never set well there and would become lumpy.</block>

<block position="left-top">If you want to keep their mouths open, insert a little bit of <material>harpsichord string</material>, which will not take up much space.</block>
