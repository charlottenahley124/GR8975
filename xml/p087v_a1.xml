      <material>Sand</material>, when overheated, does not hold as well. <material>Slate</material> is baked and will mold clean, yet it is true that often it becomes porous, just like <material>burned earth</material> also does, as well as any kind of greasy <material>sand</material>.

      I find that one must not hammer at all on <material>sand</material> already very finely pulverised, because it would damage it, and then make the <material>sand</material> would not be able to release the cast cleanly. Still, it needs to be pressed hard, and moisten it sufficiently.
