    <heading>White bronzing on plaster</heading>

    <block>One must apply four layers of painters' distemper glue onto the plaster portrait, leaving
        one layer to dry at a time. Then apply gently some burnt English point ground on a marble
        slab, or some lead burnt, ground and distempered with a bit of gum or glue. When dry, rub
        gently with a little cotton and the plaster portrait will look like lead. Others grind
        minium with quicksilver.</block>
