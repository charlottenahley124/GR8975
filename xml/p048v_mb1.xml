    <margin-block position="left-bottom"> To properly alloy the <material>tin</material> and the <material>lead</material>, you
        have to melt them together, Then, mix them together a little bit at a time and throw it
        often on a <material>marble tile</material>. And when it is going well, you will see it becoming unified
        and shining as if it were burnished. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much
            <material>lead</material> and sometimes due to too much <material>tin</material>. There is some
            <material>tin</material> allied with more <material>lead</material>. Ordinary
            <material>tin</material> is allied with some <material>lead</material>.</margin-block>
