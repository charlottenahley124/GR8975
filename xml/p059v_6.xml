    <heading>Mending cracks in a panel</heading>

    <block>If a painted panel breaks you can glue it well on the reverse, but to fill in the cracks
        properly in order to paint and repair it, you must not use any <material>glue </material>,
        which weakens in damp weather and would swell when touched with the <material>oil</material>
        of the painting. But have some <material>white wax</material>, which is harder than the
        other sort. The <material>oil</material> mixed into the <material>wax</material> prevents it
        from melting in the sun. The <material>wax</material> must not be hard, but soft as if
        recently cooled. Apply it on cracks and crevices with the tip of a knife, then
        scrape.</block>
