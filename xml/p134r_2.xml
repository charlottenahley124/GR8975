    <heading>Sand made of crocum [ferri]</heading>
    <block> You can use the mixture made of crocum ferri to cast silver or gold, this mixture will
        make these casts firm, and prevent these from cracking and making burrs. And I believe that
        for flat things, it would withstand severa casts. Which however is not commonly done for
        gold and silver. </block>
