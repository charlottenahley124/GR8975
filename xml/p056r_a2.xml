    <heading>Varnish for tempera</heading>

    <block>You can make tempera marble with <material>lacquer</material> or
            <material>rose</material> of Ghent and <material>chalk</material>. Once dry, glaze it
        with lacquer mixed with <material>wine</material>, for glue will dull and blacken it. And
        the whole will firstly appear red, but the varnish you will apply, which will penetrate it,
        will make dark and light parts appear as they should. The varnish is made like this: mix
        with clear <material><place>Venice</place> turpentine</material> some <material>aspic
            oil</material> until it becomes clear and liquid, and this is done without fire. This is
        for things done in tempera, and the turpentine varnish that you know is for panel paintings.
        Pure lavender spike varnish is not good for panel paintings because lavender spike oil is
        too penetrating and makes colours shine unless it has been made long beforehand.</block>
