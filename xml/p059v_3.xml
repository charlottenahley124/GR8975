    <heading>Folds in clothing</heading>

    <block>You must take care not to represent any folds falsely, but rather imitate natural
        effects. Thick cloth hardly makes any folds, <material>taffetas</material> and
            <material>silk</material> cloth make more, and <material>crepe</material> more still.
        Observe which folds go lengthwise and which across.</block>
