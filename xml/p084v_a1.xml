<body>
  <purpose type="making"/>
I tried the <material>hoof of an ox</material>, quite burned, pulverized and very well crushed on <tool>porphyry</tool>, until it is fine enough to slip through your fingers without being felt. On its own, it makes a very clean mold. But because on its own it is very dry and lean, it demands to be well wet and humidified, with a <material>thick broth</material> with <material>elm root</material>.

<body>
  <purpose type="making"/>
<material>Dross of Iron</material>, very burned <material>ox hoof</material>, and felt, all burn well in a closed fire. All three ground very finely on <tool>porphyry</tool> mold very neatly in lead, without any need to reheat it much, and by casting in a box mold either hot or cold.
