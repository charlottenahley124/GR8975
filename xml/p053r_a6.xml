    <heading>Lead and copper casting</heading>

    <block>Lead and tin come out well in white chalk but the softer it is the better. That from
        Champagne wins first prize, and it is transported to <place>Lyon</place>. Burnt and
        calcinated horse bones cast very neatly.</block>

    <block position="left-bottom">I believe that the marrow from the horns of oxen or sheep, that is
        to say, the spongy bone from inside, casts quite neatly and is better than bone.</block>

    <block position="bottom">Note that any sour metal comes out better than a fat one. Also, lean
        sand receives it and absorbs it better than dense sand.</block>
