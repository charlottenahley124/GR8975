<heading>Wheat oil</heading>

<block>Is made on a <tool>blade</tool> of <material>iron</material> reddened in the fire, and the <material>oil</material> turns into drops, which is appropriate to <material>oil</material> the hair of a <animal>butterfly</animal> or similar thing, because this <material>oil</material> is instantly dry and makes the rest dry out.  It is necessary that the coat or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, because if left standing up, it will make the <material>sand</material> raise up and form bubbles.</block>

<block position="left-middle"> # If you want to mold something delicate, like a <plant>pansy</plant>, some, to give it a little thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with <material>butter</material>.  But it is best to oil it with <material>wheat oil</material> because it has no opacity and does not block the smaller features as much, and makes the <plant>flower</plant> firmer.</block>
