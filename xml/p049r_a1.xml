    <block>Those who cast these small items, sold in front of the churches, melt half a pound of
            <material>lead</material> on a pound of <material>tin</material>, and cast in a
            <material>stone</material> frame. And if they want their work [to be] whiter, they use
        half of <material>tin</material> and half of <material>lead</material>, but the first
        mixture is the best, and does not make bubbles.You have to cast it hot enough, otherwise it
        won't flow. Some [people] smoke their molds with a <material>rosin</material>
        <material>candle</material> for neat casting. The <material>antimony</material> makes the
        matter harsh and breakable. The <material>looking-glass</material>
        <material>tin</material> makes the work whiter, but does not make it flow more than with
            <material>tin</material> that is correctly made with pure <material>lead</material>.
        Those who make very precise <material>lead</material> castings use puncheons. Tintiers cast
        with <material>copper</material> molds. It is said that one makes <material>lead</material>
        adhere to <material>glass</material> by using <material>resin</material>. Some people put a
        quarter of <material>tin</material> on <material>lead</material>. <material>Glass</material>
        <material>tin</material> makes the work stronger.</block>
