        <heading>Vine leaf and small frog</heading>
    <block> To mold, take vine leaves as they are blooming, just as with all herbs &amp; flowers, or
        a young vine regrowing after it has been cut or when the leaves come off in autumn, because
        new leaves are knottier &amp; have more evident veins. By contrast, old leaves are smooth
        all the way through &amp; full of holes in many places. Place therefore your leaf, its back
        behind it against the clay plaster, and fasten it with little pins. Leave it nevertheless
        with its natural curling. And make a notch in the clay to hide the stem for the first cast.
        And when it's done and dry, take out the stem of the leaf and clean it well with your jacket
        and press it with a little scoop of clay. Afterwards, make many castings around the leaf
        with wax, as you know well, &amp; make a slender casting &amp; with many lines &amp; knots. </block>

    <block position="left-bottom"> You can cast a spider or frog &amp; whatever you like on the
        leaf. </block>
