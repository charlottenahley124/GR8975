<heading>Casting of lead and tin in plaster</heading>

<block>If you want to cast any flat medal or any animal that is not very heavy, and that must not be burnt inside the mold, you can indeed cast in mixed plaster &amp; brique, as above; and not in plaster alone, because it contracts too much feeling an ardent fire if it is not so mixed. But, with the brick, it holds well. However, take heed to dry out your mold at length &amp; on a slow fire &amp; with patience, because there is no need to reheat it. But when your work is of flowers or other things that want their mold to be reheated &amp; set ablaze, mix the plaster with stone alum &amp; even with crocum. I have molded in very neat plaster &amp; brick &amp; it has sustained several castings.</block>

 When there is nothing to burn in the mold, it is not necessary to reheat it for lead and tin. But for flowers and other things that must be burned, it is.
