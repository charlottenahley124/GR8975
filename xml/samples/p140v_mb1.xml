 I tried both plaster &amp; brick alone and molded en noyau with like the others. My mold was very clean, having lightly oiled &amp; rubbed my medal with spirits. I made my casting wide at the entrance, narrowing it as it goes along until it reaches the medal which is very thin. I notched the casting which embraced the medal well. I dried the mold out well on a slow fire &amp; finally, I heated it well without turning it red. I let it cool in such a way that I could hold my finger to it without burning myself. I made a line of 4 ℥ of tin, &amp; ix deniers of lead. I cast it red, and it was quite good and beautiful. Afterwards I put xii deniers of leadon top of 4 ℥ of tin. It is very good &amp; beautiful.
