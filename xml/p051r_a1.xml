    <heading>Copying off patterns</heading>

    <block>Make some <material>soap water</material> and with it, rub and moisten the
            <material>engraved stone</material> that you want to transfer the pattern from, then lay
        a white sheet of <material>paper</material> on it and rub strongly against it with a sharp
        piece or the bottom of a <material>glass</material> bottle and you will transfer your
        stamped piece. It is true that it will be on the left side, but if you apply
            <material>aspic</material> or <material>turpentine oil</material> on your
            <material>paper</material>, it will be stamped on the right on the other side. Then
        trace these lines with a paint brush or a quill, then heat the <material>paper</material>
        and the <material>oil</material> will evaporate and it will leave your
            <material>paper</material> white. And if you don't want that to be known if, by chance,
        you borrowed the <material>cut stone</material>, soak the <material>paper</material> and the
        polishing that the polisher made on the back side, which distinguishes what has been made,
        will not be recognizable. The <material>soap water</material> will turn the piece yellow,
        but well <material>gummed wate</material>r, which has the same effect, does not do this. If
        you want to, for the same effect, make <material>gummed wate</material>r then, dissolve some
            <material>soap</material> in it and do as is said.</block>
