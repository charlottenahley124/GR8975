    <heading>Hot-worked <material>steel</material> and files</heading>

    <block>The <material>steel</material> that blacksmiths and other iron workers commonly use is
        not refined like that from <place>Germany</place> or <place>Biscay</place>, which is
        hardened in a <material>molten iron</material> bath, but among the <material>iron</material>
        in bars which is transported by flatboat from the forges of <place>Foix</place> and
        elsewhere, some is harder, whiter and more refined than the rest, as it comes from the mine.
        And the workers choose it and use it like the other <material>steel</material>. And because
        it consists of <material>common iron</material>, they call it strong
            <material>iron</material>. But it is not of such good quality as purified
            <material>steel</material> like that from <place>Germany</place> and
            <place>Biscaye</place>, which is sold in small beads. Some hot-work their
            <material>steel</material>, giving it a heating and then dipping it into a large
        quantity of <material>water</material>, then forging it. And fine
        <material>steel</material>, which is brittle, does break and crumble, whereas
            <material>iron</material> can be pulled out. Thus they separate the finest
            <material>steel</material>, which with another heating they make into a mass. The
            <place>Germans</place> make their files from strong <material>iron</material>.</block>

    <block position="left-bottom"><material>Steel</material> is applied to tools not on both sides,
        but underneath the part where one sharpens and whets them, and this part must be made of
        very soft <material>iron</material>.</block>

    <block position="left-bottom"><place>Levantines</place> refine our own
            <material>steel</material> because their country provides them with none, and they
        reheat it in a pot with <material>bitumen</material> etc.</block>
