<heading><m>Gilding wood</m></heading>

<block>First of all it is necessary to apply a coat of very clear <m>glue</m>; and when it is dry, you will apply a coat of yellow <m>gold</m>; and when this is done you will take <m>fig tree wood</m> and soak it for a while, and wash the place you want to gild, and cut your gold with a <t>knife</t> near where you will put it; and said gold must be applied with <t>cotton</t>, and if you can find some fig tree, take an <m>egg white</m> and stir it frequently.</block>

<block>If your gold does not have a nice enough color, you will take a <m>partridge feather</m> burn it in a <t>chafing-dish</t>, and turn the smoke toward what you have gilded.</block>
