It wants to be well recooked for big metal objects. Some people burn it inside a <tool>furnace</tool> until it becomes quite black and they grind it on the <tool>porphyry</tool>. Other people burn it with <material>asphalt</material>, but when it is too burned, it does not mold so cleanly, because it lacks body, and is too thin. You can give body to the sand with <material>tripoli</material> or <material>burned felt</material>.
