    <heading>Gold casted very thinly</heading>
    <block> When goldsmiths have to solder something quickly but don't have enough time to forge it,
        they melt gold and then they pour it on a cloth or on anything else that withstands fire.
        Then they flatten it swiftly with a hammer or another similar tool, and it [the gold] is
        very tenuous and it even retains the impression of the cloth. </block>

    <block> Unalloyed pure gold can be cast into a medal but not into herbs and lizards or other
        very delicate things if it is not alloyed. </block>
    <block> A pansy which is oiled with wheat oil can be cast with alloyed gold. </block>
    <block> And other fruit leaves, but with branch[es] that are not large and especially the
        leaves, once cast, can be soldered. </block>
