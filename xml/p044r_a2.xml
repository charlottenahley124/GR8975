    <block>They mix viii or ten pounds of lead for each hundredweight of tin in the cities that have
        regulated guilds. But elsewhere, they add as much as they can. One also uses ii. lb. of

        kettlemakers make. This makes the vessel more reverberant and it is not as breakable.</block>
