    <block> Model any drawing in half relief on a flat slate in order to set it on round or flat
        things. Cast with very fine tin, then you can gild it with gold leaf, and set it wherever
        you want. Fill the bottom of the relief with small rubies, orpiment, or any colored little
        grains.</block>
