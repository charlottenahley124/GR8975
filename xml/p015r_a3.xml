    <heading>Casting gold and silver</heading>

    <block>The sand must be made from something very dry and arid and reheated well because, if it
        were humid, like founder's sand, the gold and silver would leap out of the mold and sustain
        damage. It is also necessary for the earth to absorb the metal because cast gold or silver
        become very porous. That is why it must be beaten out again, otherwise it is brittle, as
        seen in spoon handles.</block>
