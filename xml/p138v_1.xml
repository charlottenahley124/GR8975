    <heading> Talcum mixed with the molds </heading>
    <block> I used the one from which I had extracted the oil. I crushed it very finely even more
        into a steel mortar with a pestle [which was] rough like a file. I crushed it very finely
        into a cottony, downy powder. I mixed it with the sand and soaked both matters together, and
        I casted it en noyau. It molded very clean and there is no doubt that it will withstand
        fire. </block>
