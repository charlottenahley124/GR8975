<heading>Spirits</heading>

<block><purpose type="observation"><material>Spirits</material> are excellent for making molds clean, in such a way that where you do not apply some, <material>common sand</material> will attack the figure. But it needs to be passed three times. And because it does not take well on oiled things, I believe it may be best to put some into the <material>water</material> with which you have moistened your <material>sand</material>.</purpose></block>
