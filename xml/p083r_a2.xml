<heading>Sand for copper medals</heading>

  <purpose type="making"/>
Recipe: Take <material>hat</material> felt burnt on a covered fire, <material>iron dross</material>, and <material>burnt bone</material>, all of which you should grind very finely, crush and spray with <material>water</material> and <material>salt</material>. Make a paste of it, mold it, and wipe it with <material>hay fire</material>. These three pulverized sands, having been very well refined on the <tool>porphyry slab</tool>, mold very well and cast well. Know that separately each of them is quite good. Burnt felt molds well and is removed quite neatly.

<material>Plaster</material> molds quite neatly but it swells. <material>Bone</material> does not have much body while <material>iron dross</material> does. Felt allows for an easy removal of the cast.
