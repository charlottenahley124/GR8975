    <heading>To recognize good azur dust for oil</heading>

    <block>The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is finer. Also
        the one that is also very pale in color, because oil darkens it. Certain sophists mix them
        together, but you will find this out if you pour some onto a piece of paper and lay it flat
        and spread it with your finger since, if it is mixed, it will be found varied and so to say
        with light and darker stripes, but if it is whole it will be even and of one color.</block>
