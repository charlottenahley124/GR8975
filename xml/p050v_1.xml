    <block><animal>Buntings</animal> sing during the night if they are left in the cool open air,
        but they are better suited to fattening for fine tables than for singing.
            <animal>Chaffinches</animal> are prone to blindness, and their eyes swell at the
        beginning of August. <animal>Goldfinches</animal> love <material>lettuce seeds</material>,
        and you can catch them in gardens on seedy lettuce using two
        <material>lime-twigs</material>. But because such a daily fayre would be too expensive for
        them, they are usually fed with <material>hemp-seed</material>. The <animal>owsell</animal> is
        purged with a <animal>spider</animal>, which you must give it once a week, so that it
        doesn't become too strong. The <animal>lark</animal> is purged with <material>dry
            mortar</material>, composed of <material>lime</material> and sand, to keep it from
        becoming too strong and fat. Small young birds are purged with the same <material>dry
            mortar</material>, by placing small lumps of it in their cages. The
            <animal>cuckoo</animal> lays its eggs in the nest of the <animal>bunting</animal>,
        otherwise know as <animal>verdaule</animal>. This bird is very simple-minded, I have
        previously let two go, which after a few days returned to their cage. To feed young
            <animal>goldfinches</animal>, it is necessary to crush <material>almonds</material> with
        very fine <material>breadcrumbs</material>, and <material>lettuce seeds</material> or
            <material>hemp seeds</material>. For <animal>linnets</animal>, some
            <material>rapeseed</material>.</block>
