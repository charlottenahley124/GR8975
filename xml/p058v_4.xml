    <block><material>Turpentine oil</material> makes it very beautiful, try some <material>palma
            christi seed oil</material>. <material>Nut oil</material> in Flanders costs at least a
        hundred sols a pint. The azur requires some greasy oil for it is not thick</block>

    <block position="left-middle"><material>Enamel azur</material> hates more than any other to be
        ground, even with some <material>water</material> for it dies and loses all its color.
        Because however it cannot be used if it is big, grind it not with some water but with some
        oil and grind it thickly and so it will not die</block>
