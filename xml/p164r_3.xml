<heading>Leaded silver</heading>

<block><purpose type="observation">A lot of <material>silver</material> is wasted because of the lead which is mixed with it, as occurs in cupellation, and makes it leap in small bits onto the edges of the crucible and onto the charcoal which covers it and is also gross. And by this means, it is good to melt <material>silver coins</material>, like reals and others, and make them into ingots prior to casting lizards or animals, for it comes out better. I cleanly molded a small, <material>silver viper</material>, like in the first recipe above. And at the end of the line of <material>4 reals (of 20 S of Spain)</material>, and <material>one coin of 20 S from France</material>.</purpose></block>
