<heading>Composition of <material>sand</material></heading>

<block>Everything being baked thoroughly as said above, take four 4 molds full of <material>plaster</material>, two 2 of <material>brick</material>, and one of <material><foreign language="French">alum de plume</foreign></material>. Do not pass through the <tool>sieve</tool> to mix, because the <material>alum</material> would not go through. Mix it with your hands until neither one nor the other, neither white nor red, may be distinguished from the other. If your <material>plaster</material> is not strong, do not mix in as much <material><foreign language="French">alum de plume</foreign></material> because it softens molds. Make sure too that your <material>sand</material> is not hot (since it has been baked thoroughly recently) when you will want to mix it with <material>water</material>, because that makes molds too soft and breakable.</block>

<block position="left-bottom"> You may sometimes decrease the quantity of <material>plaster</material> if you do not find it strong enough to resist fire and if it splits, so that the proportion of crushed <material>tiles</material> sustains it, with the <material><foreign language="French">alum de plume</foreign></material>, which you can also increase so that it creates a better bond.</block>
