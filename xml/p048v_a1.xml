    <heading>Regulus extracts</heading>

    <block>Take one pound of <material>antimony</material>, half a pound of <material>black
            soap</material>, and half a pound of <material>Montpellier tartar</material>. Once it is
        all pulverized, you have to boil it in a <material>varnished earthenware pot</material> on a
        big <material>fire</material> as you stir it with a <material>piece of wood or
            iron</material>. The <material>soap</material> will burn off and be consumed by the
            <material>fire</material> and the rest will stay red. The quantity has to be reduced to
        a third. Then throw that on a <material>tile</material> and it will turn blackish. You will
        have to melt and pour that on a <material>tile</material> four or five times and then you
        will have <material>regulin from antimony</material>.</block>

    <block>Others pulverise the <material>antimony</material> and mix it with equal quantities of
            <material>saltpeter</material> and powdered <material>tartar</material> and heat a
            <material>pot</material> or <material>crucible</material> until it is red hot, then add
        a little bit at a time, turning their back for fear of the smoke, and keep doing so until
        everything is added. They maintain the <material>fire</material> until everything is
        completely melted and melt that several times.</block>
