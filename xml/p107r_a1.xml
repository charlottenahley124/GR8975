<heading>Catching <animal>lizards</animal> and <animal>snakes</animal></heading>

<block>Take a <tool>stick</tool>, pin a net with a slipknot to the top. Whistle, and move the net nearer to the head of the <animal>lizard</animal>, and pull when it put it's head inside the net. It is more difficult to take a <animal>lizard</animal> with your hands than a <animal>snake</animal>, because <animal>lizards</animal> bite without letting go, and bite as strong as pincers.</block>

<block>You can take <animal>snakes</animal> with your hand, but cover your handle with a <tool>woollen cloth</tool>, because the teeth of the <animal>snake</animal> could go through a <tool>common cloth</tool>. You can recognize dangerous <animal>snakes</animal> by their blue eyes. They do not bite into <material>water</material>, as it is known by <profession><animal>crayfish</animal> catchers</profession>.</block>
