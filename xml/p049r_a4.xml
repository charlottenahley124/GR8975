    <block>They add one lb. of <material>glass</material>
        <material>tin</material> to one quintal of <material>fine</material>
        <material>tin</material>, which makes the <material>tin</material> ticker. There is two
        kinds of <material>tin</material>, one which flows better, like <material>lead</material>,
        while the other one is sour and can be made thicker. They are casted in thick and solid
            <material>tin</material> molds or, to cast more neatly, in chisel-engraved
            <material>copper</material> molds, or <material>stone</material> or
            <material>earth</material> [molds]. <material>Latten</material> scrapings mixed in make
        the <material>tin</material> more breakable and harder, and more difficult to work with.
        They cast in the very hot molds some very hot <material>tin</material>. They perfume their
            <material>tin</material> molds with <material>resin</material>
        <material>candles</material>.</block>

    <block><material>Sour</material>
        <material>tin</material> is often mingled with <material>salmons</material>, easy to cut but
        difficult to work with and melts if it is not mingled with the other
            <material>soft</material> one. And thus it would become leftover.</block>
