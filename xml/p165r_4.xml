<heading>Plaster for molding</heading>

<block position="left-middle"><purpose type="application"><activity type="molding">When it is long to set and dry, it means that it is too fat and moist, which is what makes it shrink away from the fire and crack. [This is] where burrs come from. The one that comes from lean earth is better. You must not store your moulds made of <material>fat plaster</material> for a long time, because they resemble fat earth, which when drying, cracks. The best is to reheat them soon after they have been made and cast. Moulds made of <material>good plaster</material> can be stored a long time.</activity></purpose></block>

<block><purpose type="advice">It is necessary to oil it well, because it is more difficult to separate the two halves of these moulds than when it is mixed.</purpose></block>
