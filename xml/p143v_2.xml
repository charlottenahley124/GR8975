    <heading>Iron filings</heading>
    <block> Because usually filings are mixed with impurities, it is good to heat them over fire to
        burn the filth and then wash them in clear water. In this way, the dirt will rise to the top
        of the water, which you will throw out, and the good filings will go at the bottom. </block>
