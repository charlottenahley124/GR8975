 <heading>Excellent temper for breastplates</heading>

 <block>Have the clearest and the most running river <material>water</material> you can, and heat it
  up slightly more than warm. Then have a bunch of <material>reseda</material>, take its seeds and
  dip them into the said water and bring it to a rolling boil it while stirring it with a stick.
  Then pour it into a <tool>muid</tool> or any other vessel, then throw into it two pecks of
   <material>salt</material>. Then take a big cauldron full of the said river water and heat it up
  slightly more than warm. Take three or four times the quantity of <material>red greasy
   earth</material> you can hold in two cupped hands, dip it and throw it into the
   <tool>cauldron</tool> filled with the said water. Have as much <material>pigeon manure</material>
  as of the said earth, as much <material>horse manure</material> and as much <material>iron
   scrapings</material>. And mix each of these separately, throw into the caldron and leave for two
  or three days. Then throw it into the said muid and stir all strongly altogether. And the older
  this temper is, the better it will work.</block>
