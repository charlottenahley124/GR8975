       Azur desmail always wants to be cleaned because the filth that can be seen in the used water would makes it die. It always needs to be coated twice, &amp; first very thickly, driving the pinceau by laying it lengthwise then across. It is better used on canvas, which imbibes it immediately, than on wood. Varnish restores its vigor, because while imbibing, it becomes dark. To try it, painters bring their palettes to the grocers and distemper and mix @ it with a bit of white crushed in oil, for in this way the beautiful shows its turquine vivacity, while the mediocre is lavender grey. The thinner one is best to work with. It is made thinner by being washed.
