    <heading>Horsehair sieves</heading>

    <block>They are made often in Normandy with horsetail hairy that they clean with some washing
        water because they pick them out with their mouth and separate short and broken ones. They
        do not make the thread longer than the sieve and it is round. They attach the black or white
        hair at the two edges of the thread, according to the piece they want to make. And the
        thread is woven above and below like any other fabric. And passing a small flat stick of ii
        or three fingers wide between two, they pass between after two bits of hair at each step
        strike and weave with three steps. The entire sieve is made of xvii bits of hair. They sell
        them by dozens and each xxx sols. They bring them to Toulouse to send them then to Spain and
        there, they exchange it with silk.</block>
