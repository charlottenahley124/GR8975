<heading>Stripping animal</heading>

<block>If you'd made such a twist to your <animal>snake</animal> that you can not stripped its belly easily of the mold, and if the head and the mouth are thinner, and easier to be removed, do cut away the extra parts of the mold, and do reheat the mold again. The matter inside will burn, then add some <material>quicksilver</material> inside which will attract <material>ashes</material> and burnt bones, the <tool>pipe</tool> will get wider, and your <animal>animal</animal> will get easily out of the mold without being damaged. You can strongly pull your molded <animal>snake</animal>, because it is soft and malleable, and your mold firm enough to keep its print undamaged.</block>
