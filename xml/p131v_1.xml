    <heading> When lead or tin casts fill with bubbles </heading>
    <block>If your casted work became porous, it can be repaired with very firm wax, and you can
        gild or silver it afterwards. If you cast fine, the alloy of one ℥ of lead to one lb of tin
        is good. But if you cast with lead[ligue illegible], indeed you need one lb of lead to two ℥
        of tin, because lead is fat and sticky, goes over the alloy. I have cast a very small lizard
        that way. If you cast something thick, which keep the heat for a long time, it will make
        bubble if there is not enough tin. Your mold should not be cold, but cool enough that you
        can hold it without burning your hand, or that you can hold your finger into the cast
        without burning yourself. Your tin or lead must be like red. Cast your lead first, then cast
        tin. When you are going to cast, add a piece of resin to your mixture, then a little
        looking-glass tin. If you add too much lead to your tin, the mixture wouldn't be fluid
        enough. To know [the right proportion], If tin cries loudly, it means that there is not too
        much lead; if tin cries softly, it means that you added too much lead. Be wary </block>
    <block position="left-middle">You can solder with the same matter, then rework it and [remove
        away all the unwanted thick parts] with a burin. </block>
    <block position="left-middle"> Tin is a metal that can[…], makes bubbles and burn, and more
        capricious to work with than gold and silver. </block>
    <block position="left-bottom"> Lead must not be only red, it must be quick, and as liquid as
        water, which is a sign of its perfect heat. Your mold must be so hot that you couldn't bear
        to put your finger into it. Do not open your mold until is has cooled down. Just as for
        silver and gold, it is a sign of good casting when lead comes out through the vent holes. </block>

        <block> not to heat your mold too hot because it makes it brittle, it makes bubbles and
        shrinks tin, and would also break the molded thing. Do not dip you hot mold into water
        because tin and lead would shrink. </block>
