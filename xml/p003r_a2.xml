 <block>
Take a <unit>pound</unit> of <material>Venice turpentine</material> and heat it in a <tool>pot</tool> until it simmers, put in half a <unit>pound</unit> of the <material_format><material>whitest turpentine oil</material> you can find</material_format> and stir all together well on a <tool>charcoal fire</tool> and take it off immediately after, and it is done. But if you find it too thick, add more <material>oil</material>, whereas if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little <material>turpentine</material>. And so you will give it whatever consistency you want. It could be made without <tool>fire</tool>, but it is more desiccative when heated. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things, without distorting the colors or yellowing, and dries both in the shade and under the sun, overnight, and during the summer as well as in the winter. It is usually sold 15 sols a <unit>pound</unit>.</block>
<block position="left-bottom">You need a little more <material>turpentine</material> than <material>turpentine oil</material> to thicken the <material>varnish</material>, which you need to apply with your finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick because when it is thick, it turns yellow and gathers [together]. <material>Varnish</material> is not used to make paintings shine, because it just takes the light out of them.</block>

<block position="middle-bottom">But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust. <material>Mastic varnish</material>es does not resist rain, whereas <material>oil [varnish]</material> and <material>rosin varnish</material> do.</block>
