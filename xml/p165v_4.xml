<block>When reheating, you might as well use common <material>lute</material>, But when you want to cast, strip it from the <material>mold</material> and, using a <tool>brush</tool>, quickly apply a layer of plaster <material>lute</material> that has been used for molds, because it will be dry as soon as it settles, and cast. This <material>lute</material> should be mainly placed on the joints.</block>
