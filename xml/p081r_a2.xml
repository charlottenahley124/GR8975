It releases better than <material>plaster</material> or <material>sulphur</material> which become hard once they have grasped on <sup>to the mould</sup> because <material>earth</material> sticks. It needs to be beaten vigorously so that it does not break. If the piece you want to mould is very large you can mould different parts separately. If you reheat it, it must be over a closed fire. One finds this earth at <place>Le Fousseret</place>, and in another place called <place>Ox</place>.
