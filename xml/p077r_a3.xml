      Founders use [this earth] to make the handles of their bells. Before it [the earth] is used, they beat it quite hard, [and] then they leave it to dry gradually in the shade for a long time. And they mold it quite neatly. But the <material>earth</material> must not be sandy; rather, the <material>earth</material> must be carefully selected and soft.
