In order to catch them, you must observe them in real life, the food that they favor and their mating season.  The <animal>nightingale</animal>, as long as he is singing, marks his own territory.  Therefore approach him by pretending to look for something on the ground.  Take some <animal>worms</animal> from <material>old flour</material> or from beneath what you are kneading or from mills, which <animal>nightingales</animal> love, and put some on your hat, fastened with a pin or in any other way, so that it can wiggle.  And five or six steps away from the hedge where it is singing, dig a hole, and place some worms in it, as well as your device made out of little criss-crossed sticks.  As soon as you leave it will be anxious to go and see what you have done.  And seeing <animal>worms</animal> it will enter.
