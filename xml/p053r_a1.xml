    <heading>Soldering a vise</heading>

    <block>It is good that the <tool>jaws of the vise</tool> should be high for use in making a long
        piece, and that they join well to clamp a thin object. In order to solder the nut, after you
        have made the bolt, you will make a long iron strip of the right thickness to fit into the
        notch of the bolt when red hot, and you will bend it all around [the bolt] by striking it
        with a <tool>hammer</tool>. Once it is well wrapped around, you will insert the bolt around
        which the nut is wrapped.</block>
