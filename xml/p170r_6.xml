<block>You have to leave them cool down rather than blow inside to clean them, because they hold the ashes when they are hot. Once cooled, they are easier to clean. Have a find <material>brass wire</material> or <material>steel wool</material> to thoroughly clean the <material>guene</material> because it is through it that you cast. Blow into it and siphon, bringing it to you. Give it volume before casting the <material>tail</material> with <material>wax</material>, then cut it.</block>
