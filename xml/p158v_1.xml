    <heading>Colors for green leafs</heading>

    <block>
        One usually paints them with <material>oil colors</material>, because
            distemper colors do not stay on. For <material>marigold flowers</material>, lightly
            ground <material>minium</material> for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a
            bit of <material>massicot</material>. For <color>green</color>, the <material>vert-de-gris</material>
            is dark and too somber. If it is a <color>yellowish-green</color>, you can mix with the
                <material>vert-de-gris</material> a bit of <color>yellow ochre</color> and <color>scudegrum</color>. If the <color>green</color>
            is dark, mix in some <material>coals</material> made from peach pits, which makes a <color>greenish-black</color>, in the
            same way than the <material>bone of an ox foot</material> bone makes a <color>bluish-black</color>. And in such a manner, by
            judgement and discretion, put the color on the <material>natural flower</material> or <material>leaf</material> to see whether it
            is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features
            of the work.
