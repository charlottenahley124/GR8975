<heading>Catching birds</heading>

<block>During winter, when birds have molted, skin them and fill them with cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your birds on trees, have some [look like they are] singing, [look like they have assembled] and are numerous.</block>

<block>the oven must not be too hot. This [method] is good in the summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they [birds] could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the winter, because they dry by themselves.</block>
