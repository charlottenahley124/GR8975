<heading>Repairing</heading>

<block><purpose type="advice">It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a <tool>burin called an "onglet"</tool> or the one called <tool>"chaple"</tool> or with a <tool>small file</tool>. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While reworking, moisten and rub your work with a <tool>small bristle brush</tool>.</purpose></block>
