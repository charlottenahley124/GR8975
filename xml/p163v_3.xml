<heading>Repairing</heading>

<block>It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a burin called an "onglet" or the one called "chaple" or with a small file. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While reworking, moisten and rub your work with a small bristle brush.</block>
