<heading>Crocum</heading>

<block><purpose type="observation">That which has become rusty by itself, having been doused with <material>water</material>, <material>salt</material>, and either <material>vinegar or urine</material>, and then well-dried and reddened by heating, is deep red when crushed on porphyry and is of the color of bol de levant, almost like minium. But that which is doused with <material>urine</material> and dried acquires a deeper color and almost like crushed aes ustum or like vermillion. But the first one, finely crushed, acquires a bright red color like cinnabar when placed in spirits. And the one and the other, when prepared as said above, finely ground and made very hot, produce a red smoke like an acid vapor if, being thus hot and fine, one throws vinegar, urine or spirits on top. The <material>urine</material> makes a lot of color and the <material>spirits</material> as well.</purpose></block>
