It is necessary to take <material>paper</material> from <place>Florence</place>, which is the finest, and crush it and and soak it several times and change the <material>water</material> every day, that way it does not smell bad. And after having moulded it into the hollow, put a <tool>cloth</tool> over it, and from the back side, rub the back of your <material>paper</material> with a sharp piece, as if you wanted to polish it and it will mould very neat. Then glue some <tool>cloth</tool> from the back side with strong <material>glue</material>.
