<heading>Rock and cavern</heading>

<block>You need to grind white and yellow <material>marcasites</material> &amp; various kinds of <material>mines</material>. Wash them thoroughly, so the soiled and chalky end will be clean, in order that only the lustrous grain of the <material>mine</material> will be left, from which you will powder your <material>rock</material> previously covered with <material><foreign language="French">colle forte</foreign></material>, if your cavern is not used as a fountain and touches <material>water</material>. You will thus obtain a nice work.</block>
