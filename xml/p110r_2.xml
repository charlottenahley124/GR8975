<heading>Rock and grotto</heading>

<block>You need to grind white and yellow <material>marcasites</material> &amp; various kinds of <material>ores</material>. Wash them thoroughly, so the soiled and chalky end will be clean, in order that only the lustrous grain of the <material>ore</material> will be left, from which you will powder your <material>rock</material> previously covered with <material>strong glue</material>, if your grotto is not used as a fountain and touches <material>water</material>. You will thus obtain a nice work.</block>
