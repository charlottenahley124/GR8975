<heading><animal>Mussels</animal></heading>

<block>There is nothing better for opening them up than to oil them with <material>olive oil</material>, and nothing else. And afterwards, when you want to separate them, soak them in cold <material>water</material>; that is the secret. And you will see that the <material>oil</material>, although it seems to be imbued, will separate itself from the <material>water</material> as does <material>grease</material>. <animal>Mussels</animal> become stronger in cold <material>water</material>, and warm <material>water</material> would dissolve them with difficulty, although having been reheated, the <animal>mussels</animal> are then more handleable and easy to dissolve in the <material>water</material>.</block>
