    Since, I molded with <material>burned bone</material>, <material>dross of iron</material> &amp; <material>burned felt</material>, really crushed and ground on <tool>marble</tool> and mixed together. I got them very wet with beaten <material>egg white</material>.  And, as in the other [casts], having covered the medal and filled the box frame with <material>sable de mine</material>, I gave it a little tap. I found it really stripped &amp; molded quite neatly.

And my <material>sand</material> was not corrupted at all.  Since, I have cast in there many casts of sweet <material>lead</material> and <material>tin</material>, which came out the best and neatest of any others I have yet found.

    <material>Potin</material> from <material>sernique</material> &amp; other works runs yet better than fine <material>latten</material>.  But I believe that half <material>copper</material> and half <material>latten</material> is better, which has served &amp; been in very thin works, like frying pans &amp; similar ones.  I've seen come out quite well this mixture of half
