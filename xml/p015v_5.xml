    <block>When a defluxion occurs in the ear, be very careful not to put anything in it, and
        following the proverb, ears and eyes should only be touched with your elbow. However, to an
        affected ear, it is good to apply musky cotton, that is to say, cotton kept in musk, which
        comforts quite well.</block>
