    <heading>Dyes from flowers</heading>

    <block>Red poppies that grow amongst wheat make a very beautiful columbine on white leather. The
        boufain makes a very beautiful blue. An herb which grows in hedges, which has a stem similar
        to flax, long and broad leaves like little bugloss, which has a violet flower verging on
        blue and looks like the fleur de lys, makes a quite beautiful turquin, better than azure.
        Another columbine flower of the shape and size of the bugloss flower, which has a leaf like
        that of the pansy, also makes a very beautiful turquin. It grows in wheat in light earth.</block>
