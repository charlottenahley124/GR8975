<block position="left-top">First cast the tail or the back of your <animal>animal</animal>, make a cut from the head to the middle to the tail where you cast, and which is the end of the mandore. After casting do not forget to make holes, and to notch your casted <material>metal</material>. That way <material>metal</material> will run better than if do not notch it.  Indeed <material>metal</material> get damaged into notches, do not run too much and does not swell as much as if you do not make any notch. Put small <tool>clamps</tool> made of wire to the joints separating both molds it will reinforce the joints of your mold. <tool>Clamps</tool> prevent molds from distorting and from getting damaged while heating.</block>

<heading>Note about everything above said</heading>

<block>If your <animal>snake</animal> hasn't eaten for a long time, when you want to kill it into <material>urine</material> and <material>vinegar</material>, it would fill with water and would swell, and then it would dry when you fix it on <material>clay</material>.</block>

<block>Once casted, and removed out of the mold, you could see a small empty line between the animal and the mold where <material>sand</material> will come in when you make the second cast. Try to avoid that if you can, but do not give up  your second casting because not much <material>sand</material> comes in this empty space and it will be easy to clear it with the help of a small <tool>needle</tool>, also this <material>sand</material> does not stick to the first cast.</block>

<block>Casts which must be reheated, like casts for <material>gold</material> or <material>silver</material>, or other matters which must be burnt inside the mold, need more <material>stone alum</material> than casts which are stripped of the mold easily, like <material>lead</material> and <material>tin</material>. However do not add too much <material>stone alum</material>.</block>
