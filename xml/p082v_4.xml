<foreign language="French">Laiton de potin</foreign>, which is the most acid, moulds neater than <material>latten of cassole</material> according to many people. All fine latten molds cleaner than <material>red copper</material>. If you want to cast something fragile and tenuous, the secret is casting as hot as possible so that the matter boils. You will know that it is hot enough when it smokes a lot and stirring it makes sparks. For heating well you should place your <tool>crucible</tool> as low as possible, close to the forging <tool>mill</tool>, so that the <tool>bellows</tool> blow on the middle of the <tool>crucible</tool>, thus it heats better than on the grate on which we usually put the <tool>crucible</tool>, under which the <tool>bellows</tool> blow. It is true that the <tool>crucible</tool> can easily break but you can lute it as you know founders do.  You need to keep feeding the fire with <material>coals</material>, which are between the <tool>bellows</tool> and the <tool>crucible</tool>. Make sure to cast all at once and not in increments or drop by drop, otherwise the conduit will be plugged by the matter. It is better to make an abreveoir to abreuver  the medal. It is necessary that you stir the melted matter with a <tool>stick</tool>, so that the matter at the bottom heats well. Because <material>Iron</material> turns the matter acid. Turn

Some people add <material>wool</material> stuffing to heat up and make it runny.

Place one large <tool>iron slab</tool> under your <tool>crucible</tool>, the plate will redden and  this will maintain the heat under your crucible.

<material>Copper</material> matter is good to cast because when broken, its grain is long and not short, that shows that the matter is soft. The matter is composed half of fine <material>latten</material> and half of <material>red copper</material>. This long grain is called longue tige long rod.
