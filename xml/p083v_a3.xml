To cast with a <tool>bellows furnace</tool>, cast the hottest you can. Do not place your <tool>bellows</tool> at the bottom around the base of the <tool>furnace</tool>, lest some <material>coal</material> should enter them. Place the <tool>bellows</tool> under the grate. It is wise to place your furnace in a place where there is wind so that the heat will grow better. It is necessary to stop carefully the doors of the <tool>furnace</tool>, that way only the <tool>bellows</tool> have an opening. At the end of the cast, you will blow slowly, as you did at the beginning.
