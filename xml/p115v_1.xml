<heading><material>Tin</material> casting</heading>

<block>If the <plant>herbage</plant> or <plant>flower</plant> you want to cast is delicate and fine, <material>tin</material> must exceed <material>lead</material> in your mixture; on the contrary, if it the <plant>flower</plant> or herbage is thick,  you must add into your mixture more <material>lead</material> than <material>tin</material>. For a fine thing, add one part of <material>tin</material> for four parts of <material>lead</material>. Your mold must not be too hot, so you can hold it with your hand when you cast. Your alloyed <material>tin</material> must be very hot and almost red for casting, and that way it will enter all the small parts of the mold. Otherwise, your <material>tin</material> will cool down before reaching the thin parts of your <plant>herbage</plant>. Do not forget to mix a little <material>bismuth</material> in your mixture; that way, your <material>tin</material> will run better and be firmer.</block>

<block position="left-top">With your <material>lead</material> allied with <material>tin</material>, or <material>tin</material> allied with <material>lead</material>, you can add a very little quantity of <material>bismuth</material> and it will look silvery. But do not put too much, because if hardens the matter and makes it sour, and if your work on fine things -- like legs and similar things -- it will not cast properly.</block>
