<block><activity type="making">One must first make the branches from <m>wood</m> or take a fantastical <flora>thorn</flora> branch, then melt a <measure>pound</measure> of the <m><m_format>best possible clear </m_format>pine resin</m> and add one <measure>ounce</measure> of <m><m_format>finely ground</m_format> vermilion</m> together with <m>walnut oil</m>, and if you add a little <m>Venice lake</m> the color will be all the more vivid, and stir all together into the <m>resin</m>, molten over a <m>charcoal</m> fire, not over an open flame, lest it catch fire. Then dip in your branches with a swirling motion. And should there remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the <m>charcoal</m>.</block>


<block position="left-top"><activity type="advice"><m>Colophony</m> is nothing other than <m>resin</m> that has been cooked again. To do it well, you take a <t><m>leaded</m> pot</t> and melt the <m>resin</m>, boiling it over the <t>brazier</t> for a good <time>hour</time> until it appears not thick but clear and liquid like <m>water</m> and it easily runs as a thread off the end of a stick, which you use to crush and test it. Then pour it through a coarse <m>canvas</m> or <m>tammy cloth</m> so that it falls into the strongest <m>vinegar</m> you can find, because the <m>vinegar</m> makes it strong and makes it less brittle. Repeat this two or three times and it will be fine and well purified. To imitate your <m>coral</m>, you can mix a <measure>fourth part</measure> of <m>mastic</m> with your purified <m>resin</m> to make it more solid and finer, and if you should use just one <measure>drop</measure> of <m>mastic</m>, it would be all the better, but it would take too long.</block>



<block position="left-middle"> <activity type="advice"> <m>Sulfur</m> and <m>vermilion</m> have the same effect.</block>

<block position="top"><activity type="advice"> <m>Coral</m> made of <m>red enamel</m> withstands filing and polishing.</block>

<block position="right-top"><activity type="advice"> It is made like <m>cement</m>, which is stronger when mixed with <m><m_format>crushed</m_format> glass</m> rather than with <m>brick<//m>. In the same way, together with the <m>vermilion</m>, one mixes in <m><m_format>opaque</m_format> red enamel, <m_format>finely ground</m_format></m>. It is the same way with all <m>enamel</m> colors.</block>
