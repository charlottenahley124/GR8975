    <block> Enamel takes more readily on copper than on silver. It is true that the cut needs to be
        well hollowed out &amp; rough. Azure in body &amp; the red called gules, white enamel &amp;
        thick green take very well. Having enamelled, one gilds the feuillages of the
        cutting[illegible]. Copper has a similar hardness when cut as pure silver or pistolet
        gold.</block>
