    <block>Those from <place>Bayonne</place>, which seem to be made of <material>gr√®s</material>,
        are better because they last, without comparison, longer than others. And since they are not
        very thick, one wastes less <material>charcoal</material> to melt <material>gold</material>
        and <material>silver</material> because they are quickly heated. They do not absorb
            <material>silver</material> as much as others, and for this reason, there is not much
        laveure to be found in them. They are also not as likely to fall over as others that have a
        flat bottom.</block>
