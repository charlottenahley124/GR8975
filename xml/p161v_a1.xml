<heading>Crocum ferri</heading>

<block><purpose type="making">It can be made quickly if you put very filings that are very neat and have been washed in an <tool>iron drum</tool> that is only <unit>two fingers high</unit>, and cover it, and redden in a <tool>reverberation furnace</tool>, having washed it in <material>good vinegar</material> for a whole day. And it will be very well burnt and clean, mixed and crushed on a <tool>marble slab</tool>. Having been well crushed and when well mixed, the <material>vinegar</material> will corrode it easily and will redden it quickly and bind it. Wet it with the strongest one you can find and burn it after. And after three or four wettings and burnings it will be ready. This one will be the color of <color>columbine</color> and is considered firmer for casting than the one that is redder and more beautiful in color, done with rusty filings and has more color in it</purpose>. <purpose type="advice">Some burn the filings many times on a shovel of red iron, watering each time with vinegar.</purpose></block>
