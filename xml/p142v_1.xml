If you have to mold a piece of written-on paper that is too thin, after you have done the first cast and it has set, give a little thickness to the reverse of your paper with melted butter, which is the most appropriate means there is, &amp; for strengthening the wings of either a butterfly or a grasshopper, or any delicate part of an animal to which you need to give thickness. But take heed to apply this melted butter under the wing or in whichever place it will not be seen.  For giving thickness to a pansy or other flowers, butter is not good, but rather wheat oil, which is soon dry &amp; holds firm.  Wax would not be appropriate here for it is too hot once melted, and it makes the thing to which it is applied contract.  But butter is amiable and handleable.
