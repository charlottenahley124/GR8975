  <heading>Molding grasshoppers and things too thin</heading>

  <!-- <related-block>  -->
    <block purpose="making"> If you have to <activity>mold a piece of <keyword>written-on paper that
          is too thin</keyword></activity>, after you have done the first cast and it has set, give
      a little thickness to the reverse of your paper with <material>melted butter</material>, which
      is the most appropriate means there is, &amp; for strengthening the wings of either <keyword>a
        butterfly or a grasshopper</keyword>, or any delicate part of an animal to which you need to
      give <keyword>thickness</keyword>. But take heed to apply this melted butter under the wing or
      in whichever place it will not be seen. For giving thickness to a <keyword>pansy or other
        flowers</keyword>, butter is not good, but rather <material>wheat oil</material>, which is
      soon dry &amp; holds firm. <material>Wax</material> would not be appropriate here for it is
      too hot once melted, and it makes the thing to which it is applied contract. But butter is
      amiable and handleable. </block>

    <block position="left-top" purpose="advice">If you write on paper or on common carton and your
      letters are made with <material>gum</material>, the moisture of the <tool>clay plate</tool>
      (?) or the wet (?) <material>sand</material> for a <material>noyau</material> will moisten
      your letters and undo them. Write therefore with <material>cinnabar mixed with oil</material>,
      on oiled &amp; stamped (?) paper. </block>

  <block position="left-middle" purpose="advice"> + Reheat your molds with
      <material>charcoal</material> firstly lit in the forge, so that the fire is not too hot and
    does not break the molds. And do not fire as strongly where the mold is thin as where it is
    thick. </block>
