<heading>Giving ventilation to your mold</heading>

<block>If your <plant>herbage</plant> is very fine, in addition to vents, you can drive a thread through the <material>clay</material> contour of your <plant>herbage</plant> instead of casting with a <tool>needle</tool>, and thread it also in the <plant>herbage</plant>. The thread will burn, like the <plant>herbage</plant>, and the hole will remain, thus giving extra ventilation.</block>

<block position="left-middle">Do not remove your annealed molds out of the fire before they have cooled down by themselves. Also make sure that your very hot molds do not come into contact with wind or coldness otherwise they would burst. Do not reheat your molds before they are drained and firm again, otherwise they would cast before the vent holes are made and the <tool>clamps</tool> are fixed.</block>
