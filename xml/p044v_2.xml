    <heading>Excellent water against the pest by the Master of Montorsin</heading>

    <block>Take some theriac rue, dittany and good vinegar, put the whole in a glass bottle and
        leave it half-open and well attached. And put it in a bath for three or 4 days. Then take
        some of your brew from its container when you need it and pour some, when necessary, on a
        red hot tile and receive the vapor and also perfume your clothes. This is a very precious
        and proved secret.</block>
