    <block>If you want to keep them moist and prevent them from losing their initial color, pour
        some <material>white wine</material>, the whitest and the clearest you can in a bottle with
        some <material>tragacanth gum</material>, and once you have corked the bottle, mix and shake
        it very strongly, and leave it still until the tragacanth is dissolved. Add also some fine
        white earth to lighten that. Some mingle the white wine with some spring water, and with
        this composition they mix their colors without grinding them, and they show very beautifully
        on miniature works.</block>
