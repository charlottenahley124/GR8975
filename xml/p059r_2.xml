    <heading>Azure</heading>

    <block><material>Azure</material> is more beautiful when on the painting it has soaked up some
            <material>nut oil</material> with which it has been firstly thinned without any
            <material>oil of spike lavender</material>. If you want to know whether it is dry,
        breathe on it and it will not shine and will seem to be very soaked up, otherwise it will
        shine</block>

    <block>Soaked with <material>oil</material>, <material>azure of email</material> leaves it and
        comes back to its first natural state if you dip it in some
        <material>water</material></block>

    <block>Colors for small scale works have to be very strongly ground and to be worked with a
        brush point if you want your work to be very fine</block>
