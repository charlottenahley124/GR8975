<heading>Catching passerines</heading>

<block><purpose type="advice"><activity type="catching">If they sleep in the farmyard, like they commonly do, close to the house, let the closest window open, and put a lighted candle close to the window. The candle itself must be hidden, only its glimmer must be seen through the room and through the window; all the passerines will then lock themselves into the room. But the night must be very dark, without any moonlight.</activity></purpose></block>
