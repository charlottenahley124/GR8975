    <purpose type="making"/>
    <activity type="casting animals"/>
    <block> One has to display it on the jacket of <material>clay</material> as it is said for the
            <plant>vine leaf</plant>. Then do the first cast. And once it dry, peel the mold off to
        the middle of the legs and do the second cast. </block>

    <block> Also. One cannot mold the hairy legs of big <animal>spider</animal>s or any other hairy
        animal if they had not been rubbed with <material>wheat oil</material> before they are laid
        flat. This will make the hair firmer and will dry very quickly. Hairy things entangle in the
            <material>sand</material>, and do not burn very well. </block>
