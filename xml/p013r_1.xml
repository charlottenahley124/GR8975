    <heading>Flesh color with arsenic</heading>

    <block>Sublimated arsenic, that is to say, the white kind sold as stone, when powdered on
        marble, mixed with vermilion or laque or mine, produces a beautiful flesh color that always
        shines. Yellow arsenic has a very beautiful color, the white one works well in oil and goes
        well with lake.</block>
