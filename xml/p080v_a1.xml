<heading>Founders of small <m>tin</m> work</heading>

<block>They usually cast from soft <m>solder</m> the things that should not become hollow, because hollow works require fine and <m>soft tin</m>. However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they are mixed or include <m>glass tin</m>  in them, just like they mix a little <sup><m>glass tin</m></sup> in the <m>soft tin</m>. They carve their work on <m>stones</m> of which the sharpening stones or barber's files are made. These are found in great flakes near the <pl>mountains</pl>, and resemble <m>slate</m>. They are found in three colors: one reddish, that is not as perfect as the others because it does not sustain heat ; <sup>another\</sup> one  is the color of dark <m>slate</m>, and the other is whitish. When they work a relief, first they print it on <m>carton</m>, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their <m>stones</m> and rubbing them together , they use a <t>compass</t> or <t>little iron tools</t> to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four <m>stones</m>, to make a circle or a square with the <m>stones</m> which join perfectly because the <m>stones</m> are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with <m>tallow</m>, and it <sup>the mould</sup> absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having <sup>put</sup> fine powder of <m>quicklime</m> into a <t>cloth</t>, they rub the mould using pounce in beating the <m>linen</m> on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles <sup>from forming</sup>. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown <sup>on the picture</sup>. They make a hole in the <m>medal</m>, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the side of the <m>medal</m>. </block>

<block>And if they want their work to last, they pierce <sup>it</sup> somewhere and fit in a piece of <m>cork</m>. <m>Lead</m> or <m>tin</m> will not damage it. </block>
