    <block>Some to make it flow neatly, put half <material>metal</material> and half
            <material>copper</material>. Others take a part of <material>potin</material> and a part
        of <material>copper latten</material>. Others take a part of <material>latten</material>
        from candlesticks and a part of <material>latten</material> from a basin. And among basins,
        the <material>latten</material> from larger ones is harder than that from skillets because
        the material needs to be softer in order to give them such a small circumference. From the
        large ones, from which they take the more ample circumference, the harder material can be
        taken. The harder the <material>latten</material>, the better it flows and the neater it
        casts, but it must be cast very neat hot. As one wishes to cast, one puts
            <material>lead</material> on the material, which makes it flow and run and goes up in
        smoke and be careful that the mold does not get damaged. And if you want to cast pieces on
            <material>fire</material>, mix more <material>rosette</material> than
            <material>latten</material>, so that it is less brittle. The crucibles used to melt
            <material>metal</material> should be better than those used by glassmakers because glass
        is not as heavy as <material>metal</material>. And in this instance, the crucibles need to
        be luted with <material>earth</material> and crushed <material>glass</material>.</block>
