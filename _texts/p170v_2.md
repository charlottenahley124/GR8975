## Against plague

 
Against pestilential fever or poison or plague, take an ecu's weight of your <span class="material">opiate</span> soaked in <span class="material">scabious</span> or <span class="material">bugloss extract</span>, or heavily diluted <span class="material">wine</span>, if you are already ill. After taking it, you must make yourself sweat.
