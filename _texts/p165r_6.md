## Repairing snakes and lizards

 
You could make some marks according to the form of their scales, making some bigger ones and some smaller ones, according to the shape of the neck, the body and the tail. If there is something broken, you can attach it with small <span class="material">iron or steel nails</span>, and glue it with some <span class="material">mouth glue</span>, then cover the whole thing with gray or black <span class="material">wax</span>. But it is necessary to let the <span class="material">glue</span> dry for one day without touching it.
