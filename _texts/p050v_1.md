##  <span class="animal">Little Birds</span> 

 
<span class="animal">Buntings</span> sing during the night if they are left in the cool open air, but they are better suited to fattening for fine tables than for singing. <span class="animal">Chaffinches</span> are prone to blindness, and their eyes swell at the beginning of August. <span class="animal">Goldfinches</span> love <span class="material">lettuce seeds</span>, and you can catch them in gardens on seedy lettuce using two <span class="material">lime—twigs</span>. But because such a daily fayre would be too expensive for them, they are usually fed with <span class="material">hemp—seed</span>. The <span class="animal">owsell</span> is purged with a <span class="animal">spider</span>, which you must give it once a week, so that it doesn't become too strong. The <span class="animal">lark</span> is purged with <span class="material">dry mortar</span>, composed of <span class="material">lime</span> and sand, to keep it from becoming too strong and fat. Small young birds are purged with the same <span class="material">dry mortar</span>, by placing small lumps of it in their cages. The <span class="animal">cuckoo</span> lays its eggs in the nest of the <span class="animal">bunting</span>, otherwise know as <span class="animal">verdaule</span>. This bird is very simple—minded, I have previously let two go, which after a few days returned to their cage. To feed young <span class="animal">goldfinches</span>, it is necessary to crush <span class="material">almonds</span> with very fine <span class="material">breadcrumbs</span>, and <span class="material">lettuce seeds</span> or <span class="material">hemp seeds</span>. For <span class="animal">linnets</span>, some <span class="material">rapeseed</span>.
