## Shadows

 
First shadows which are closer to the daylight have to be light and very faint then the last ones very dark to enhance strongly the relief. The Italians usually make three shadows, the first one very faint, the second one darker and the third one very dark, then put these three shadows together by hatching them from the darkest to the lightest
