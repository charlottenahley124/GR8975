## Baker

 
 Dust guards wheat against being wormâ€”eaten. And to clean it well when it is stained & like rust, pass some ashes through a sieve and mix them with the wheat, then sift the whole thing with a bolting cloth made from rough cloth or canvas. The ashes will pass through & your wheat will stay nicely yellow & very fine.
