## Excellent <span class="material">sand</span>

 
 Burn <span class="material">alabaster</span> in a <span class="tool">crusol</span> under charcoal fire until it turns into powder. Once it is cold, finely pulverise it through a <span class="tool">sieve</span> to make it impalpable. With a pound of <span class="material">alabaster</span>, one should use an ounce of <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span>. Mix well and incorporate everything together. Next, put it in a cave or a wet location. And with this paste, mold whatever you need and then dry the mold under a fire. While the <span class="material">sand</span> is hot, you cast whatever metal you may like and your cast will be as neat as the principal. And the sand will always work if it is kept in a wet location and dried by the fire.
