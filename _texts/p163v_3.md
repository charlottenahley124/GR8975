## Repairing

 
It is much better to only lightly repair your work with a <span class="tool">burin called an "onglet"</span> or the one called <span class="tool">"chaple"</span> or with a <span class="tool">small file</span>. Above all, avoid touching your work, but touch only the burr or lumpy parts that will have occurred during the casting. While reworking, moisten and rub your work with a <span class="tool">small bristle brush</span>.
