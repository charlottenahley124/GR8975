## Pewterers 

 
They add one lb. of <span class="material">glass</span> <span class="material">tin</span> to one quintal of <span class="material">fine</span> <span class="material">tin</span>, which makes the <span class="material">tin</span> ticker. There is two kinds of <span class="material">tin</span>, one which flows better, like <span class="material">lead</span>, while the other one is sour and can be made thicker. They are casted in thick and solid <span class="material">tin</span> molds or, to cast more neatly, in chiselâ€”engraved <span class="material">copper</span> molds, or <span class="material">stone</span> or <span class="material">earth</span> [molds]. <span class="material">Latten</span> scrapings mixed in make the <span class="material">tin</span> more breakable and harder, and more difficult to work with. They cast in the very hot molds some very hot <span class="material">tin</span>. They perfume their <span class="material">tin</span> molds with <span class="material">resin</span> <span class="material">candles</span>.
 
<span class="material">Sour</span> <span class="material">tin</span> is often mingled with <span class="material">salmons</span>, easy to cut but difficult to work with and melts if it is not mingled with the other <span class="material">soft</span> one. And thus it would become leftover.
