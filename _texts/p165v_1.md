## Positioning animals

 
<span class="activity">Not only with <span class="material">iron pins</span>, but also with <span class="material">melted wax</span>, are animals secured to the <span class="tool">plate of earth</span>. Wash them first in clear water, after they have died in the mixture of <span class="material">vinegar</span> and <span class="material">urine</span>. And with a <span class="tool">sponge </span>clean off their mouth, eyes and head of the froth coming out, because the <span class="material">sand</span> would never set well there and would become lumpy.</span>
 
> *at left top  margin of folio 165v*
> 
> If you want to keep their mouths open, insert a little bit of <span class="material">harpsichord string</span>, which will not take up much space.
