## Keeping birds and animals

 
Take a measurement from [the part of] their body that is fleshy and more susceptible to decay, with some <span class="material">canvas</span> that you shall cut according to their size and width. Having filled this with <span class="material">cotton</span> and stitched it, skin them. But leave the head, neck, wings and feet of birds, and head, legs, feet and tail of animals, because those dry easily. Then use that <span class="material">skin</span> to dress the mold made of <span class="material">canvas</span>. Small ones can be dried in an oven or covered in <span class="material">sel ammoniac</span> and (?).
