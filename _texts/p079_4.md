## Mixture for printers

 
 Apply a coat of antimony, and pulverize on a coat of latten, old metal scrapings, or thin plates of iron or the iron nail heads, and continue in this way until the crucible is full. Melt it inside a four à vent. And then mix in a little tin and fill the rest of the container with lead. Build up the fire and stir continuously to make sure that the substances are well—allied. The mixture for large letters is harder.
