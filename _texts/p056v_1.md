## To paint

 
The <span class="material">lacquer</span> and <span class="material">rosette from Ghent</span> and elsewhere lose their color and die in contact with the air.
 
Any <span class="material">marble</span> on which a knife can [illegible] is not worth to grind fine colors.
 
The <span class="material">chalk</span> is not thick with <span class="material">oil</span>, the <span class="material">ceruse</span> is more appropriate but even better is the <span class="material">white lead</span>. The <span class="material">ceruse</span> is the whitest and is to grind firstly with some <span class="material">water</span>, the white lead is grayish. But turns perfectly white with some <span class="material">oil</span>.
 
When you grind your colors, start by cleaning your workshop because if you raise some dust while walking that will damage your colors which will never be beautiful if they are not clean.
 
The <span class="material">Florey</span> must not be mingled with some <span class="material">azur enamel</span> or anything else for it turns it into green.
 
<span class="material">Ivory</span> is excellent to make a painter's' palette Knots of the fir tree The pearâ€”tree and if it is walnut tree make sure to cut with the grain of the wood.
 
You always have to stamp on <span class="material">wood</span> to <span class="material">oil paint</span> in order to fill holes and unevenness. And stamp with some [illegible] and <span class="material">ceruse</span> mixed with oil, then soften with a feather which evens more than a brush. Or when the stamp is dry, rub it strongly off with a knife.
 
To use some <span class="material">azur enamel</span> with some <span class="material">oil</span>, you have to choose the finest one and to make it thinner, do not grind for it turns white but wash it and because the bigger goes at the bottom, choose the one at the top of the <span class="material">water</span> or pour the cloudy <span class="material">water</span> out and pile the <span class="material">azur</span>.

<span class="material">Lake</span> takes a long time to dry in <span class="material">oil</span> and for that reason you have to crush <span class="material">glass</span> with it, but you have to choose <span class="material">crystallin</span> because it is neater. And since it would be too difficult to be crushed by itself, you have to heat it red hot, then, when it is entirely red, throw it into cold <span class="material">water</span> and it will crumble and pulverize itself to then be crushed easily. After being crushed with a lot of <span class="material">water</span>, it looks like crushed <span class="material">lead white</span>, but for this reason it has no body. I think it could be good for casting.
 
<span class="material">Lead white</span> is made with <span class="material">lead</span> sheets beaten gently and put under some manure.
 
White <span class="material">turpentine</span> varnish or <span class="material">aspic oil</span> and <span class="material">turpentine</span> is colored with powdered <span class="material">turmeric</span> boiled together with it. It gives a <span class="material">gold</span> color on <span class="material">silver</span> which is even more beautiful when burnished. It dries within a quarter of an hour. <span class="material">Aloes</span> would made an even brighter color but it takes time to dry whereas the other one dries within a quarter of an hour in winter as well as in summer.
 
 Good <span class="material">lake</span> moistened with <span class="material">saliva</span> quickly darkens. That from <span class="place">Florence</span> is mixed with too much <span class="material">gum</span>.
 
If you apply one layer of <span class="material">printers' ink</span> on <span class="material">velvet</span> and apply <span class="material">gold</span> leaves and then stretch it, it looks grainy as if it was powdered with <span class="material">gold</span> sprinkled on it.
 
<span class="material">Vermillion</span> crushed by itself is wan and pale but is more beautiful when it is crushed with <span class="material">lake</span>.
 
In order to remove the <span class="material">grease</span> off <span class="material">marbles</span>, one crushes <span class="material">ordinary ashes</span> on it, which afterward are good to make the first primer coat of a painting to be done in <span class="material">oil</span> in order to seal the cracks and veins of the <span class="material">wood</span>. They are thicker than <span class="material">chalk</span> and are quite greasy. They are mingled with the aforesaid <span class="material">chalk</span> or with colors collected from the vessel that is used to clean brushes, and they are desiccative and spare the colors. Once this primer coat has been made on the <span class="material">wood</span>, it is scrubbed with a knife until even. After, one makes a second coat with <span class="material">ceruse</span> or with the poorest colors mixed together. On an <span class="material">oil</span> canvas painting one only applies one coat and the mixed <span class="material">ashes</span> can be used. Also, after crushing a color, one crushes the <span class="material">interior of a large loaf of bread</span> in order to remove the <span class="material">grease</span> off the <span class="material">marble</span>.
