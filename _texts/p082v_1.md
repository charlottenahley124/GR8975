## Casting <span class="material">lead</span> in <span class="material">lead</span>

 
 Some make their caves with <span class="material">lead</span>, they make them thick, and then cast <span class="material">lead</span> in it. 
 
 <span class="material">Lead</span> that is not cast hot enough is white, and darker when cast very hot.
