## Sable

 
If you don't add enough <span class="material">alum de plume</span> or <span class="material">crocus</span> your mold will easily crack when heated. But if your <span class="material">sand</span> is mixed as it ought to be, the mold will sustain itself. You'll know it's of good quality when, while still hot after casting, it immoderately soaks up the water when dipped and breaks easily, because the <span class="material">alum</span> and the <span class="material">crocus</span> render it spongy. To the contrary, <span class="material">bad sand</span>, which is composed of <span class="material">plaster</span> and <span class="material">brick</span> and is not well mixed with alum, breaks easily in fire and hardens in water. If possible, cast all at once.
