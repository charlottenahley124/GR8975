## <span class="material">Sand</span> of <span class="place">Toulouse</span>

 
 The <span class="material">sand</span> generally considered good is the one found in a vineyard near <span class="place">Pech—David</span>. But the best is the one is from the <span class="place">Touch</span>, a river close to <span class="place">Saint—Michel</span> and <span class="place">Blagnac</span>, in a vineyard at a high altitude. This sand is thinner, and a bit greasier than the other, and better for small works. It should not be overheated.
