## Azure

 
<span class="material">Azure</span> is more beautiful when on the painting it has soaked up some <span class="material">nut oil</span> with which it has been firstly thinned without any <span class="material">oil of spike lavender</span>. If you want to know whether it is dry, breathe on it and it will not shine and will seem to be very soaked up, otherwise it will shine
 
Soaked with <span class="material">oil</span>, <span class="material">azure of email</span> leaves it and comes back to its first natural state if you dip it in some <span class="material">water</span>
 
Colors for small scale works have to be very strongly ground and to be worked with a brush point if you want your work to be very fine
