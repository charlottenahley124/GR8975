## Mending cracks in a panel

 
If a painted panel breaks you can glue it well on the reverse, but to fill in the cracks properly in order to paint and repair it, you must not use any <span class="material">glue </span>, which weakens in damp weather and would swell when touched with the <span class="material">oil</span> of the painting. But have some <span class="material">white wax</span>, which is harder than the other sort. The <span class="material">oil</span> mixed into the <span class="material">wax</span> prevents it from melting in the sun. The <span class="material">wax</span> must not be hard, but soft as if recently cooled. Apply it on cracks and crevices with the tip of a knife, then scrape.
