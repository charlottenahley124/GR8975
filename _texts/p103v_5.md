<span class="activity"></span>To well recognize their difference and their true <span class="color">color</span> by candlelight, it is necessary to put the <span class="tool">candle</span> behind a <span class="material">crystal</span> mirror, or a <span class="tool"><span class="material">glass</span> globe</span> or <span class="tool">jar</span> full of <span class="material">water</span>, because this light is like sunlight.
