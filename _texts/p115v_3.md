## Annealing core molds

 
After your molds have their cast vents and <span class="tool">clamps</span>, fix the <span class="tool">clamps</span> as above mentioned. Then make a round, made of bricks, at the edge of your forge, or in a clean place. Fill this round with big, half—lighted pieces of <span class="material">charcoal</span>. Put your molds on the round, and leave it during half an <span class="time">hour</span>, that way it will gently heat up and not all at once. Finally, when coals start being white, add big half—lighted big pieces of <span class="material">charcoal</span> and blow with your small <span class="tool">bellows</span> until hot. Do as such, slowly, until the molds redden inside and out. If you want to cast a <span class="plant">herbage</span> or an <span class="animal">animal</span> which are difficult to strip, and you need to burn what is in the mold, look into the cast and see if it is molds are quite red and inflamed inside; this will be a sign that they are properly annealed. If it is not so, increase the heat and keep at it until it becomes thus. If there is nothing inside the mold to be burnt, this heat is good for <span class="material">tin</span> casting. The molds for <span class="material">tin</span> casting are much better annealed in a <span class="tool">reverberatory furnace</span>.

Do not heat too much at first otherwise your molds could break
