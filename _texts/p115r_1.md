> First cast the tail or the back of your <span class="animal">animal</span>, make a cut from the head to the middle to the tail where you cast, and which is the end of the mandore. After casting do not forget to make holes, and to notch your casted <span class="material">metal</span>. That way <span class="material">metal</span> will run better than if do not notch it. Indeed <span class="material">metal</span> get damaged into notches, do not run too much and does not swell as much as if you do not make any notch. Put small <span class="tool">clamps</span> made of wire to the joints separating both molds it will reinforce the joints of your mold. <span class="tool">Clamps</span> prevent molds from distorting and from getting damaged while heating.
 
## Note about everything above said

 
If your <span class="animal">snake</span> hasn't eaten for a long time, when you want to kill it into <span class="material">urine</span> and <span class="material">vinegar</span>, it would fill with water and would swell, and then it would dry when you fix it on <span class="material">clay</span>.
 
Once casted, and removed out of the mold, you could see a small empty line between the animal and the mold where <span class="material">sand</span> will come in when you make the second cast. Try to avoid that if you can, but do not give up your second casting because not much <span class="material">sand</span> comes in this empty space and it will be easy to clear it with the help of a small <span class="tool">needle</span>, also this <span class="material">sand</span> does not stick to the first cast.
 
Casts which must be reheated, like casts for <span class="material">gold</span> or <span class="material">silver</span>, or other matters which must be burnt inside the mold, need more <span class="material">stone alum</span> than casts which are stripped of the mold easily, like <span class="material">lead</span> and <span class="material">tin</span>. However do not add too much <span class="material">stone alum</span>.
