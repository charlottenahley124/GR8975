## Casting in <span class="material">gold</span>

 
To cast in <span class="material">gold</span>, <span class="material">crocum ferri</span> is necessary, and more <span class="material">stone alum</span> than in the following mixture. The <span class="material">stone alum</span> mixture cannot spoil anything. The mold must be <span class="color">red</span> & close it immediately with <span class="material">iron</span> <span class="tool">presses</span>.
 
Shells of <span class="animal">crabs</span> &[shells of] <span class="animal">crayfish</span> are troublesome to burn & have their own proper way of being molded.
 
When molding <span class="animal">rats</span> and <span class="animal">birds</span>, the feet, being burned, are difficult to recover, because they are small and slender. The body is recovered more easily from the mold. The feet are cast in many pieces.
