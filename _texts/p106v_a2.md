<span class="material">Tiles</span> with which one covers houses, the hardest and surest and recleaned of <span class="material">stones</span> & large <span class="material">gravel</span>, are taken to mix in with the <span class="material">sand</span> for molding. But, rather, it is necessary to reheat them just until they have been quite red for one or two <span class="time">hours</span>, and crush them and pass them finely through a <span class="tool">sieve</span>.
 
Little <span class="animal">turtles</span> just out of the egg are really delightful to mold.
