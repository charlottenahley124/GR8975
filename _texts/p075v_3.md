## Gilding with ground gold

 
 Take a coquille of <span class="material">gold</span>, soak it with <span class="material">gum water</span> before you intend to work, and then apply it with a <span class="tool">brush</span>, and polish it with a <span class="tool">wolf's tooth</span> once it is dry.
