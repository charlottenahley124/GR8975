## Rock and cavern

 
You need to grind white and yellow <span class="material">marcasites</span> & various kinds of <span class="material">mines</span>. Wash them thoroughly, so the soiled and chalky end will be clean, in order that only the lustrous grain of the <span class="material">mine</span> will be left, from which you will powder your <span class="material">rock</span> previously covered with <span class="material"><span class="foreign">colle forte</span></span>, if your cavern is not used as a fountain and touches <span class="material">water</span>. You will thus obtain a nice work.
