>  To properly alloy the <span class="material">tin</span> and the <span class="material">lead</span>, you have to melt them together, Then, mix them together a little bit at a time and throw it often on a <span class="material">marble tile</span>. And when it is going well, you will see it becoming unified and shining as if it were burnished. Because sometimes it becomes spotted due to too much <span class="material">lead</span> and sometimes due to too much <span class="material">tin</span>. There is some <span class="material">tin</span> allied with more <span class="material">lead</span>. Ordinary <span class="material">tin</span> is allied with some <span class="material">lead</span>.
