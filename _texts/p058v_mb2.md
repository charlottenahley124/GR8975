> To work properly on small scale you need some very fine brushes with a strong point. And because the <span class="material">hair</span> taken from a <span class="animal">squirrel</span>'s tale is mollesin, the most careful ones use the of oldest <span class="material"><span class="animal">rats</span>' hair</span> and even of <span class="animal">dormouses</span> if they can find some and put two or three in the middle of a brush. These brushes draw a straight line like a quill and all the other hairs stick to them. The <span class="material">hair of a <span class="animal">stone marten</span></span> or of a <span class="animal">weasel</span> and small animals used to make some <span class="material">musk</span> are even better for just one <span class="material">hair</span> is necessary in a brush
