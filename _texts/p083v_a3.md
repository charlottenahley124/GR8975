## Bellow

 
> *at left middle margin of folio 083v*
> 
>  To cast with a <span class="tool">bellows furnace</span>, cast the hottest you can. Do not place your <span class="tool">bellows</span> at the bottom around the base of the <span class="tool">furnace</span>, lest some <span class="material">coal</span> should enter them. Place the <span class="tool">bellows</span> under the grate. It is wise to place your furnace in a place where there is wind so that the heat will grow better. It is necessary to stop carefully the doors of the <span class="tool">furnace</span>, that way only the <span class="tool">bellows</span> have an opening. At the end of the cast, you will blow slowly, as you did at the beginning.
