## Cast of the frame

 
 It is good to make it with <span class="material">bow wood</span>. Turn it in order to make it homogeneous, as that is important for the casting. Cover the mouth of the frame with <span class="material">clay</span> or <span class="material">sand</span>, so that the molten metal, <span class="material">copper</span> or <span class="material">lead</span>, do not touch at all the iron or latten of the frame, because it would turn it sour, and make it filled with bubbles. Always cast higher than the mold. Pay attention that the cast is not too wide or too deep because the narrowest is the best one. Because when it is large, the weight of the matter which runs breaks and spreads the mold and fills the matter with bubbles. When you have casted, gently hit your frame, so that the matter spreads better. <span class="material">Black lead</span> [de saulmon] of the first melting, works very neatly.
