## <span class="material">Plaster</span>

 
 It needs to be well cooked, which you will recognize when cooking it in an <span class="tool">iron or metal casket</span>. Mix it with an <span class="tool">iron rod</span> and if it sticks to the iron, it is not cooked enough, and if it doesn't then it is ready. The <span class="material">water</span> with which you soak it has to be a little warm and the mould of the above mentioned earth or other, also should be a little hot. The <span class="material">plaster</span> work does not last and the faces and delicate things break if one does not use <span class="material">glue</span>.
