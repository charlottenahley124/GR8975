To dry jams that are [not?] liquid, have an open <span class="tool">tub</span> pierced on each side with a small, square window, and pass <span class="tool">sticks</span> through these from one side to the other, and place on these a sieve made of <span class="tool">strings</span> in the form of a net. And on this, you will neatly put your jam containers. And having put at the bottom of the tub a <span class="tool">hot coal</span> or two, cover the tub with a <span class="tool">cloth</span> folded in two.
