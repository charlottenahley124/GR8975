## Sand for copper medals

 
  Recipe: Take <span class="material">hat</span> felt burnt on a covered fire, <span class="material">iron dross</span>, and <span class="material">burnt bone</span>, all of which you should grind very finely, crush and spray with <span class="material">water</span> and <span class="material">salt</span>. Make a paste of it, mold it, and wipe it with <span class="material">hay fire</span>. These three pulverized sands, having been very well refined on the <span class="tool">porphyry slab</span>, mold very well and cast well. Know that separately each of them is quite good. Burnt felt molds well and is removed quite neatly.

>   <span class="material">Plaster</span> molds quite neatly but it swells. <span class="material">Bone</span> does not have much body while <span class="material">iron dross</span> does. Felt allows for an easy removal of the cast.
