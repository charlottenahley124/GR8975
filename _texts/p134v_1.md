## To make gold fluid

 
Put as much verdigris as sal ammoniac, as much borax as saltpeter. But don't add a greater quantity of borax and saltpeter than half the quantity of verdegris and sal ammoniac, in fact add as much borax and saltpetre all together as verdigris. Grind into powder the ingredients on the marble slab, then grind again with very good vinegar until it is very fine, like a ground color, grind verdigris with oil, then leave to dry if you have time, if you haven't so much time dry it with the fire of the forge, make so that it is very dry.
