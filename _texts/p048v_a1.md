## Regulus extracts

 
Take one pound of <span class="material">antimony</span>, half a pound of <span class="material">black soap</span>, and half a pound of <span class="material">Montpellier tartar</span>. Once it is all pulverized, you have to boil it in a <span class="material">varnished earthenware pot</span> on a big <span class="material">fire</span> as you stir it with a <span class="material">piece of wood or iron</span>. The <span class="material">soap</span> will burn off and be consumed by the <span class="material">fire</span> and the rest will stay red. The quantity has to be reduced to a third. Then throw that on a <span class="material">tile</span> and it will turn blackish. You will have to melt and pour that on a <span class="material">tile</span> four or five times and then you will have <span class="material">regulin from antimony</span>.
 
Others pulverise the <span class="material">antimony</span> and mix it with equal quantities of <span class="material">saltpeter</span> and powdered <span class="material">tartar</span> and heat a <span class="material">pot</span> or <span class="material">crucible</span> until it is red hot, then add a little bit at a time, turning their back for fear of the smoke, and keep doing so until everything is added. They maintain the <span class="material">fire</span> until everything is completely melted and melt that several times.
