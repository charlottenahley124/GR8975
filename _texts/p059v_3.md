## Folds in clothing

 
You must take care not to represent any folds falsely, but rather imitate natural effects. Thick cloth hardly makes any folds, <span class="material">taffetas</span> and <span class="material">silk</span> cloth make more, and <span class="material">crepe</span> more still. Observe which folds go lengthwise and which across.
