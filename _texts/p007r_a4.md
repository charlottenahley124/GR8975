##  Fish glue or usblac and mouth glue 

 
  It is made from codfish skin that has been boiled rather than salted. Joiners use it on their masterpieces and guitar makers use it for their more delicate works. It needs to be strongly whipped, then soaked gently in barely boiling water. 
 
 Mouth glue is made of parchment scraps and used to glue paper or similar things without fire, by wetting it with one's mouth.

  It is whipped and left to soak in white wine for one night, then melted over a low heat. Others soak it in spirits.
