## To give the color of all kind of metals and woods and other things

 
 <span class="activity"></span>   Take <span class="material">touchstone</span> and <span class="material">pumice stone</span> <span class="unit">as much of one as of the other</span> and grind them together, mix that with a <span class="material"><span class="foreign">colle de retailles</span></span> stronger than that used for painting, and apply a layer of it on whatever you like. Once dry, rub this layer on any metal whatsoever, then burnish it.
