## Another varnish

 
 Take <span class="material">petrol oil</span> and <span class="material">spike lavender oil</span>, in the same even quantity, and mix them together with <span class="material">copperoze</span> and let them melt over <span class="tool">hot ashes</span>, depending on the quantity you need. To apply this varnish, put three coats on the work you want to varnish.
