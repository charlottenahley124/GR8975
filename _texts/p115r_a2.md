## Stripping animal

 
If you'd made such a twist to your <span class="animal">snake</span> that you can not stripped its belly easily of the mold, and if the head and the mouth are thinner, and easier to be removed, do cut away the extra parts of the mold, and do reheat the mold again. The matter inside will burn, then add some <span class="material">quicksilver</span> inside which will attract <span class="material">ashes</span> and burnt bones, the <span class="tool">pipe</span> will get wider, and your <span class="animal">animal</span> will get easily out of the mold without being damaged. You can strongly pull your molded <span class="animal">snake</span>, because it is soft and malleable, and your mold firm enough to keep its print undamaged.
