## Wetting sand and molding the first cast

 
Have a <span class="tool">porringer</span> of <span class="material">leaded earth</span> of such a size that it can hold the wet <span class="material">sand</span> which will be needed to fill your mold in one go, which is better than in two gos, because if you do not throw the second load of <span class="material">sand</span> in very quickly, there is a risk that while you are preparing it, the first one will take and become solid,

and this way, while heating it again, the two casts will dissolve. Therefore, have several dishes of various sizes with a pouring beak in order to cast better. In these, pour some regular fountain <span class="material">water</span> and mix into it <span class="unit">as much as an egg # can hold</span> of <span class="material">sal ammoniac water</span>, mixed as described. If you want to cast <span class="material">lead</span> or <span class="material">tin</span> — because one would need more for casting <span class="material">gold</span> or <span class="material">silver</span> — having the water in your dish, add the <span class="material">sand</span> and not the other way around [by adding the water to the sand], and adjust it with such attentiveness that, while mixing it vigorously and wetting it quickly with a <span class="tool">wooden spoon</span>, it does not become thicker than <span class="material">mustard</span>. And in such a way cast [i.e., pour] first the clearest part, as is always at the surface, by shaking it a little higher in your mold. And doing so, since your <span class="animal">animal</span> is nearly covered, Once your animal is covered, blow on it very strongly to eliminate the small bubbles from your soaked <span class="material">sand</span>. Then pour immediately the rest which is at the bottom and which is thicker than the upper part, fill your mold to the thickness mark you have made.<span class="figure"></span> And while casting do not forget to shake your mold, that way your soaked sand runs and get in through every parts. Also tip your mold up on the side of the head, which is higher than the body. That way the contents of your mold will have the same thickness, and you'll spare <span class="material">sand</span>. This being done with care, your sand will harden within a quarter of an <span class="time">hour</span>. Then peel the clay contour which can be used later. Let it dry a little bit, than separate your mold from the slab of earth, and you can mold properly straight after. Cut away the extra parts with a knife, and make it mandore shaped. You can reuse the clay frame. Scrape away what's on the back of the mold, because this part is the weakest; do not forget to make notches around it, that way the second cast would bind much better<span class="figure"></span> and would not move.

> Make your mixture as clear as a <span class="material">pureed broth</span>, or <span class="material">starch water</span>, the one women use make their <span class="material">starch</span>. It is not a problem if the mixture is very thin because <span class="material">sand</span> settles in the bottom and water stays on top of it, which we scape as too weak and soft. It will not take long to harden, because burned things dry rapidly.
