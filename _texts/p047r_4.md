## Crucibles

 
Those from <span class="place">Bayonne</span>, which seem to be made of <span class="material">grès</span>, are better because they last, without comparison, longer than others. And since they are not very thick, one wastes less <span class="material">charcoal</span> to melt <span class="material">gold</span> and <span class="material">silver</span> because they are quickly heated. They do not absorb <span class="material">silver</span> as much as others, and for this reason, there is not much laveure to be found in them. They are also not as likely to fall over as others that have a flat bottom.
