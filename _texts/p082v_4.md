## Ways of <span class="material">bronze</span> casting

 
 <span class="foreign">Laiton de potin</span>, which is the most acid, moulds neater than <span class="material">latten of cassole</span> according to many people. All fine latten molds cleaner than <span class="material">red copper</span>. If you want to cast something fragile and tenuous, the secret is casting as hot as possible so that the matter boils. You will know that it is hot enough when it smokes a lot and stirring it makes sparks. For heating well you should place your <span class="tool">crucible</span> as low as possible, close to the forging <span class="tool">mill</span>, so that the <span class="tool">bellows</span> blow on the middle of the <span class="tool">crucible</span>, thus it heats better than on the grate on which we usually put the <span class="tool">crucible</span>, under which the <span class="tool">bellows</span> blow. It is true that the <span class="tool">crucible</span> can easily break but you can lute it as you know founders do. You need to keep feeding the fire with <span class="material">coals</span>, which are between the <span class="tool">bellows</span> and the <span class="tool">crucible</span>. Make sure to cast all at once and not in increments or drop by drop, otherwise the conduit will be plugged by the matter. It is better to make an abreveoir to abreuver the medal. It is necessary that you stir the melted matter with a <span class="tool">stick</span>, so that the matter at the bottom heats well. Because <span class="material">Iron</span> turns the matter acid.

>  <span class="material">Copper</span> matter is good to cast because when broken, its grain is long and not short, that shows that the matter is soft. The matter is composed half of fine <span class="material">latten</span> and half of <span class="material">red copper</span>. This long grain is called longue tige long rod.
