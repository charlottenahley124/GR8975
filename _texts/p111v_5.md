## Composition of <span class="material">sand</span>

 
Everything being baked thoroughly as said above, take four 4 molds full of <span class="material">plaster</span>, two 2 of <span class="material">brick</span>, and one of <span class="material"><span class="foreign">alum de plume</span></span>. Do not pass through the <span class="tool">sieve</span> to mix, because the <span class="material">alum</span> would not go through. Mix it with your hands until neither one nor the other, neither white nor red, may be distinguished from the other. If your <span class="material">plaster</span> is not strong, do not mix in as much <span class="material"><span class="foreign">alum de plume</span></span> because it softens molds. Make sure too that your <span class="material">sand</span> is not hot (since it has been baked thoroughly recently) when you will want to mix it with <span class="material">water</span>, because that makes molds too soft and breakable.

>  You may sometimes decrease the quantity of <span class="material">plaster</span> if you do not find it strong enough to resist fire and if it splits, so that the proportion of crushed <span class="material">tiles</span> sustains it, with the <span class="material"><span class="foreign">alum de plume</span></span>, which you can also increase so that it creates a better bond.
