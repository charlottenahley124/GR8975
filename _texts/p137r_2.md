##  Huile tingente to make metal runny 

 
 Take some mercury, some real sublimate of Venice, and not sublimate of arsenic, aes ustum a poix, sal ammoniac, a poix. Ground everything separately, then blend them together in a glass bottle, and put it on warm ashes. You will see that everything melts like wax, and will have bright colors. Leave to set, add a small quantity of this mixture on every metal, it will run marvelously.

>  Foundry workers who make large casts to mold statues, clean the dirt from these molds with calamine, and a lot of sal ammoniac in order to make moulds clear and neat. When they want to cast they add a lot of tin. Dampness and cold could spoil their works, that is the reason why even a small source of water in the hole can damage the whole thing.
