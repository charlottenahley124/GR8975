## Excellent <span class="material">sand</span> for <span class="material">lead</span>, <span class="material">tin</span> and <span class="material">copper</span>

  Since, I molded with <span class="material">burned bone</span>, <span class="material">dross of iron</span> & <span class="material">burned felt</span>, really crushed and ground on <span class="tool">marble</span> and mixed together. I got them very wet with beaten <span class="material">egg white</span>. And, as in the other [casts], having covered the medal and filled the box frame with <span class="material">sable de mine</span>, I gave it a little tap. I found it really stripped & molded quite neatly. I let it sit for a night. The morning after next I reheated it little by little for over the course of seven or eight hours (because if possible there must not remain any humidity at all in the box frame). Two times, I cast <span class="material">copper</span> alloyed with <span class="material">☾</span> there, as old <span class="material">K</span>. The material came out really lustrous & resonant & without a chappe. And my <span class="material">sand</span> was not corrupted at all. Since, I have cast in there many casts of sweet <span class="material">lead</span> and <span class="material">tin</span>, which came out the best and neatest of any others I have yet found. 
 
  When you mold make some grooves around your mold in the <span class="tool">box frame</span>, so that you draw in this manner the matter from all sides.

  <span class="material">Potin</span> from <span class="material">sernique</span> & other works runs yet better than fine <span class="material">latten</span>. But I believe that half <span class="material">copper</span> and half <span class="material">latten</span> is better, which has served & been in very thin works, like frying pans & similar ones. I've seen come out quite well this mixture of half

  In order to mold well, it is necessary to cast several medals together in a large <span class="material">box mold</span>, because when there is a lot of material and the <span class="tool">crucible</span> is almost full, it becomes hotter. Then, if you do not succeed with one of the medals, another will be good. 
 
  It is better to melt with a <span class="tool">bellows furnace</span> than with a <span class="tool">wind furnace</span>, because it heats more vigorously. It is true that <span class="material">latten</span> melts better in the <span class="tool">wind furnace</span>, because it is more brittle than <span class="tool">copper</span>. 
 
  Some founders superstitiously believe that there are only three days in a week that are good for melting, that is, Tuesdays, Wednesdays Thursdays, and Saturdays. For them, the others are unlucky. 
 
  When you mold, do not excessively pound on the medal that is in <span class="material">sand</span>, because that prevents it from being cleanly stripped, and cracks the mold. 
 
  See to it that <span class="material">sand</span> does not go over the edges of the <span class="tool">box mold</span>, because if the molded medal is higher than the cast, metal will not easily enter the form. Therefore, always take care that the surface of your cast surpasses the mold in a straight line. To accomplish this, if you wish, put a piece of cardboard of whatever thickness you please on top of the mold. 
 
  To prevent their large casting works from becoming too porous, founders are careful to heat their molds very well. And to know if the molds are heated enough, they tap them with their finger, and if they start ringing like a pot, they are heated enough. 
 
  In order to cast their <span class="material">canons</span> cleanly, they mix with their founder's earth some fine casting <span class="material">sand</span>, if they can get any.
