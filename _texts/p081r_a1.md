## <span class="material">Sand</span> work

 
 Some excellent <span class="sup"><span class="material">sand</span></span> is found for use with <span class="material">lead</span>, <span class="material">tin</span> and <span class="material">copper</span> close to the <span class="place">hill of Pech—David</span>, close to <span class="place">Toulouse</span>. It should not be reheated much because drying out suddenly, it will lose its binding <span class="sup">properties</span> and retract [?] at the first inflow of metal, which makes the work become rough and unclean. It is much better to reheat it from a distance, instead of with a <span class="material">straw</span> flame, which generates grime. Instead of filling the frame, you can use finer sand which you will have in a very thin <span class="tool">cloth</span>, and polish the medal and then the wet <span class="material">sand</span> that you will put over it, which has more body, will grip it.
