##  Molding a single spider 

  <span class="activity"></span> 
 One has to display it on the jacket of <span class="material">clay</span> as it is said for the <span class="plant">vine leaf</span>. Then do the first cast. And once it dry, peel the mold off to the middle of the legs and do the second cast. 
  
 Also. One cannot mold the hairy legs of big <span class="animal">spider</span>s or any other hairy animal if they had not been rubbed with <span class="material">wheat oil</span> before they are laid flat. This will make the hair firmer and will dry very quickly. Hairy things entangle in the <span class="material">sand</span>, and do not burn very well.
