## Making water against illness of the eyes

 
 Take some <span class="material">white copperas</span>, heat lightly over fire, then grind it to powder. Put the powder on a <span class="tool">white cloth</span> stretched over a <span class="tool">glass</span>, then take some <span class="material">fountain water</span> and filter it through the <span class="tool">cloth</span>, while stirring the powder with the finger until all the water has filtered through. Then wash your eyes as often as you wish and, with the help of god, you will feel well.
