## Making à jour letters in <span class="material">paper</span> and other work

 
If you write or trace something on the <span class="material">paper</span> and heat it soon after, and immediately it will become black; then by rubbing with a sponge, the letter will be cut out because it will be burned. Urb. Or retrace the letter with a wiped quill.
