## Repairing burrs

 
Remove burrs very carefully with the point of a <span class="tool">chaple or a burin</span>, then scrape the burrs with the side of a <span class="tool">burin</span>, or carefully with a <span class="tool">small file</span>, and rub with <span class="tool">willow coals</span> and small brushes. Continue, also, with the lines not interrupted by burrs.
