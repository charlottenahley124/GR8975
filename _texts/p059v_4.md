## Siccatives

 
<span class="material">White lead</span> and <span class="material">massicot</span> are most siccative, nevertheless they need a good two days. If you want to verify whether an <span class="material">oil</span> is siccative, use it to distemper <span class="material">white lead</span>, and if it soon produces a crust it means that it will dry.
