## <span class="material">Oil of sulfur</span> for the teeth

 
Some people whiten them with compositions of <span class="material">eau forte</span>, however one says that this corrupts them afterwards and causes them to blacken. One says that <span class="material">oil of sulfur</span> is excellent, but it needs to be applied in this way: take as much <span class="material">clove oil</span> as can be held in a <span class="material">nutshell</span>, as much <span class="material">rose honey</span>, and seven or eight drops of <span class="material">oil of sulfur</span>, and put it all together, and after having cleaned the teeth with a small burin, touch them lightly with a bit of <span class="material">cotton</span> dipped in the aforementioned oils and leave it for a little while, then spit it out or rinse the mouth with tepid water, and repeat two or three times. <span class="material">Oil of sulfur</span> penetrates and is corrosive, but the <span class="material">clove oil</span> and the <span class="material">rose honey</span> correct it. Therefore use it with discretion.
