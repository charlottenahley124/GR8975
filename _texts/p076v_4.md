## Gilding <span class="material">iron</span> or <span class="material">tin</span>

 
 First it is necessary to wash whatever one wants to gild in <span class="material">wine lees</span>, and then wash it once again with <span class="material">white wine</span>. Take three ounces of <span class="material">terra merita</span> and one choppine of <span class="material">white wine</span>. Boil the matter for half an hour, and apply your colors over your <span class="material">iron</span> or <span class="material">tin</span>, or whatever else. Then leave to dry on a sheet of paper and do not put your hand in your materials.
