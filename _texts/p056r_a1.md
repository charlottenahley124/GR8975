## Excellent temper for breastplates

 
Have the clearest and the most running river <span class="material">water</span> you can, and heat it up slightly more than warm. Then have a bunch of <span class="material">reseda</span>, take its seeds and dip them into the said water and bring it to a rolling boil it while stirring it with a stick. Then pour it into a <span class="tool">muid</span> or any other vessel, then throw into it two pecks of <span class="material">salt</span>. Then take a big cauldron full of the said river water and heat it up slightly more than warm. Take three or four times the quantity of <span class="material">red greasy earth</span> you can hold in two cupped hands, dip it and throw it into the <span class="tool">cauldron</span> filled with the said water. Have as much <span class="material">pigeon manure</span> as of the said earth, as much <span class="material">horse manure</span> and as much <span class="material">iron scrapings</span>. And mix each of these separately, throw into the caldron and leave for two or three days. Then throw it into the said muid and stir all strongly altogether. And the older this temper is, the better it will work.
