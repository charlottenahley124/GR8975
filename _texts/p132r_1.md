## Mold made from two casts

 
 It opens once anealed. To clean it after, fix the clamps again, lute the mold, particularly the joints. Then let the earth slowly dry. When it doesn't smoke anymore, let the mold cool down until you can hold it without burning your skin. Then put your molds into the presses, or into a pot filled with sand, and cast with tin. If you cast gold or silver your mold needs to be cast twice, and cast when your mold becomes red—hot.

> If your heated mold […], shrinks because of the bad quality of the plaster, open it after the first heating, tighten it, the lute it and clamp it again.
