## <span class="material">Lead</span> casting

 
Those who cast these small items, sold in front of the churches, melt half a pound of <span class="material">lead</span> on a pound of <span class="material">tin</span>, and cast in a <span class="material">stone</span> frame. And if they want their work [to be] whiter, they use half of <span class="material">tin</span> and half of <span class="material">lead</span>, but the first mixture is the best, and does not make bubbles.You have to cast it hot enough, otherwise it won't flow. Some [people] smoke their molds with a <span class="material">rosin</span> <span class="material">candle</span> for neat casting. The <span class="material">antimony</span> makes the matter harsh and breakable. The <span class="material">lookingâ€”glass</span> <span class="material">tin</span> makes the work whiter, but does not make it flow more than with <span class="material">tin</span> that is correctly made with pure <span class="material">lead</span>. Those who make very precise <span class="material">lead</span> castings use puncheons. Tintiers cast with <span class="material">copper</span> molds. It is said that one makes <span class="material">lead</span> adhere to <span class="material">glass</span> by using <span class="material">resin</span>. Some people put a quarter of <span class="material">tin</span> on <span class="material">lead</span>. <span class="material">Glass</span> <span class="material">tin</span> makes the work stronger.
