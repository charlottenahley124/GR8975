## To shoot a gun without noise

 
Warm up the barrel and close the <span class="foreign">lumiere d'embas</span>, and take a piece of the freshest porksuint that you can find and as long as the phalanx of your little finger and the size of the diameter of the canon, and push it back and forth until it is completely melted. Then, load a cartridge which fits on the top of the barrel, as you know, and it will only make a little whistling.
