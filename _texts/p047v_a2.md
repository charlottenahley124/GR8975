##  <span class="material">Melting</span> 

 
Some to make it flow neatly, put half <span class="material">metal</span> and half <span class="material">copper</span>. Others take a part of <span class="material">potin</span> and a part of <span class="material">copper latten</span>. Others take a part of <span class="material">latten</span> from candlesticks and a part of <span class="material">latten</span> from a basin. And among basins, the <span class="material">latten</span> from larger ones is harder than that from skillets because the material needs to be softer in order to give them such a small circumference. From the large ones, from which they take the more ample circumference, the harder material can be taken. The harder the <span class="material">latten</span>, the better it flows and the neater it casts, but it must be cast very neat hot. As one wishes to cast, one puts <span class="material">lead</span> on the material, which makes it flow and run and goes up in smoke and be careful that the mold does not get damaged. And if you want to cast pieces on <span class="material">fire</span>, mix more <span class="material">rosette</span> than <span class="material">latten</span>, so that it is less brittle. The crucibles used to melt <span class="material">metal</span> should be better than those used by glassmakers because glass is not as heavy as <span class="material">metal</span>. And in this instance, the crucibles need to be luted with <span class="material">earth</span> and crushed <span class="material">glass</span>.
