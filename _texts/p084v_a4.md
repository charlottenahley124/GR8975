## <span class="material">Sand</span>, for the most excellent <span class="material">lead</span> of all, for large and small reliefs

 
  I took white <span class="material">lead</span> and crushed it dry on <span class="tool">porphyry</span>, to make it very fine. Then I moistened it a lot with very well beaten <span class="material">egg white</span>, so that it became like a paste, by making it stick together perfectly with the <span class="tool">flat of a knife</span>. I let it rest for a while.

  and place it on a flat well—clean <span class="tool">table</span>, and since it has a desiccative quality, I knew it would dry out. I left it to dry for a while to reduce it to a powder and mold it with sand, it having been ground into small pieces with my fingers and the sharp side of a <span class="tool">knife</span>. I oiled my medal because <span class="material">oil</span> cleans it without damaging it. And after cleaning and drying the medal with a <span class="tool">cloth</span> and small <span class="tool">bristle brush of <span class="material">pork skin</span></span>, I lightly oiled it once more with clear <span class="material">walnut oil</span>, and gently swiped it with a <span class="tool">cloth</span> so that [the medal] would not be too oiled; having already considered that in this way [the medal] should come out easily, because the <span class="material">white lead</span>, wet with <span class="material">glair</span>, which would not damage the oil. This worked very well. I molded a medal very cleanly in high relief, without it having any lumps, which a lot of good sands such as felt, <span class="material">burnt bone</span>, and <span class="material">iron dross</span> failed to do on the first attempt. I re—cooked it and my mold became hard like marble. And then I knew that sands used to mold big relief must be very moist with some kind of water, which gives body and firmness, like <span class="material">egg white</span>, <span class="material">gummed water</span>, [or] one [water] boiled with <span class="material">elm root</span>. And lightly oil your medal. It can take as many firings as you want because it is as hard as glass. But <span class="material">soft lead</span> and <span class="material">sour tin</span> must be cast at a very hot temperature. 
 
  Since that moment, I have realized that even though this sand is excellent, can be cast often and molds very neatly, it is fat and it makes bubbles. In this way, the <span class="material">soft lead</span> does not suit the mold well. But I have tried to mix it with <span class="material">lean sand</span>, such as <span class="material">pumice</span>, <span class="material">metal scrapings</span>, and similar things, in order to give it body, and to help it come off easily, because lean sand [alone] does not come off easily; and yet it takes metal well.

And once it is in the <span class="tool">box mold</span>, beat it well on the top with a <span class="tool">pestle</span>, or something else clean. This helps to make molding better and come out more easily.
