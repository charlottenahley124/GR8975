## Killing the <span class="animal">animal</span> to mold

 
You must have been careful not to hurt it while capturing it. If you have a stock [of animals] and you wish to keep them for a long time, place it in a <span class="tool">glass bottle</span> with <span class="material">bran</span> or in a large <span class="tool">barrel</span> half full of damp fresh <span class="material">earth</span>. Give them <span class="animal">frogs</span> to eat, live rather than dead, because should you keep them without feeding them, they would wither and become emaciated, and their skin would become saggy and wrinkled. Therefore, the sooner after its capture you mold it, the better it will come out. And kill it in the following manner: place it in a clean <span class="tool">bottle</span> or <span class="tool">vessel</span> so that [the animal] does not carry any dust; fill [the bottle] with enough good <span class="material">vinegar</span> and <span class="material">urine</span> so as to cover [the animal]. Shake [the bottle] and torment [the animal] inside there until it is dead which should take an hour or half an hour. But if you are in a hurry

>  To know if [the animal] is quite dead, take it out of the vinegar and take it by the tail. If it moves its tail, do not mold it because it still has feelings, and when pricking [its members], it would remove itself and harm the mold.

to cast, force feed it your <span class="animal">animal</span> some good <span class="material">spirits</span> or mix a bit of <span class="material">spirits</span> with the <span class="material">vinegar</span>. And soon it will be dead without any wounds that would deform it. As for large <span class="animal">animals</span>, for which it is necessary to have a lot of <span class="material">spirits</span>, one uses <span class="material">vinegar</span> and <span class="material">urine</span>, but for small ones, spirits only are needed, and it will be done quicker.
 
When your <span class="animal">animal</span> is dead, take it out and clean it very carefully, relieving it of its old skin if it sheds, of its parasites like <span class="animal">lizards</span> have, and then apply it.
