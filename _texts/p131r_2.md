## molded letter paper

 
 Write with some <span class="material">ink</span> well thickened with <span class="material">gum</span> or any other color dye which has body, and which is not erased if dampened with <span class="material">brandy</span>. Then put your <span class="material">paper</span> on the sheet of clay, and dampen it with brandy. Cast both sides [of paper].
