## To make a very beautiful and inexpensive golden color

 
 First of all take a very yellow <span class="material">orange peel</span> and carefully remove the white parts, and pulverize it very well it in a very clean <span class="tool">mortar</span>. Take the same amount of <span class="material">sulphur</span>, grind all the ingredients together, pour the mixture into a <span class="tool">glass vial</span>, and store it in a cellar or other damp place for eight or ten days. When you want to apply it, the mixture needs to be warmed and applied wherever you like, and you will see a very beautiful color.
