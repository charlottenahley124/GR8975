## Colors for gold, or sauce

 
 Take as much verdigris as sal ammoniac, & saltpetre the size of a bean. Because if you put in too much, it would make the whole thing boil so much that it would all pour out. Saltpeter is only put in to make it boil, so that you know when the material has boiled enough. This color put on sour melted gold makes it soft instantly.
