## Recipe for making bronze and many kind of varnishes

 
 To make an excellent varnish with clear <span class="material">water</span> which you will use with a <span class="tool">brush</span> and which [the varnish] dries immediately for applying to paper, a little table, or any other thing 
 
 First, you will take five ounces of <span class="material">spirits</span> and one ounce of <span class="material">benzoin</span>. Crush them between two pieces of <span class="tool">paper</span> or <span class="tool">cards</span> or in a <span class="tool">mortar</span>.

 but it should not be too small, then take a <span class="tool">glass flask</span> not too big , not too small and into it put a half of each, that means two and a half ounces. Then take the mentioned <span class="material">vetjoin</span>, also roughly crushed, and add it immediately to the aforesaid water and let it rest for one and half day, and then take the aforementioned water and put it into another <span class="tool">glass flask</span> and let it soak very well. And on the rest of the aforementioned <span class="material">betjoin</span>, which remains on the bottom of the first flask, add the rest of the water on this should it react well repeat the process you just did and mix the first water with the second, because you use this to make something more noble.
