## Soldering a vise

 
It is good that the <span class="tool">jaws of the vise</span> should be high for use in making a long piece, and that they join well to clamp a thin object. In order to solder the nut, after you have made the bolt, you will make a long iron strip of the right thickness to fit into the notch of the bolt when red hot, and you will bend it all around [the bolt] by striking it with a <span class="tool">hammer</span>. Once it is well wrapped around, you will insert the bolt around which the nut is wrapped.
