## Iron wire

 
You have to be provisioned with different thicknesses according to the molds that you want to make, some large like packthread from [illegible] & some thin, like the fat cords of a spinet, for small works. With it reheated, make clamps to close the molds & make points like needles of various lengths according to your need, to fasten the animal to the mold & hold it subject. Needles would not be good for this since your points must be hollow & of the same thickness throughout, except at the point. And then you have to make them as long as you have need. Iron wire is harder than that of latten.
