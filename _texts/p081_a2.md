## <span class="material">Earth</span> for moulding

 
 <span class="profession">Sheath maker's</span> <span class="material">earth</span> or the one <span class="profession">potters</span> use to blanche the <span class="tool">pots</span> to make the <span class="material">lead</span> flow better on it and to prevent the <span class="material">lead</span> from soaking into them is very good to cast the hollow parts of what you want in relief. It releases better than <span class="material">plaster</span> or <span class="material">sulphur</span> which become hard once they have grasped on <span class="sup">to the mould</span> because <span class="material">earth</span> sticks. It needs to be beaten vigorously so that it does not break. If the piece you want to mould is very large you can mould different parts separately. If you reheat it, it must be over a closed fire. One finds this earth at <span class="place">Le Fousseret</span>, and in another place called <span class="place">Ox</span>.
