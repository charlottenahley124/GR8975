## [Information on casting]

 
The <span class="material">sand</span> mixture is made of two thirds of ground <span class="material">plaster</span>, reheated as it is said before, and of one part of <span class="material">reddened tiles</span> which are finely ground afterwards. Use also <span class="material">stone alum</span>, half of the quantity of the <span class="material">tiles</span>. Use two full <span class="unit">pots</span> of <span class="material">plaster</span>, one <span class="unit">pot</span> of tile and half a <span class="unit">pot</span> of <span class="material">stone alum</span>. Do not use too much <span class="material">stone alum</span> because that binds the <span class="material">sand</span>, and allow <span class="material">sand</span> to withstand fire without cracking or breaking. Without it <span class="material">[stone alum]</span> sand would not withstand fire, you can use it for all kind of <span class="material">metal</span>, but for <span class="material">gold</span> add a bigger quantity of <span class="material">stone alum</span>, add also <span class="material">crocum ferri</span>, because they [these filings] attract <span class="material">gold</span>.
 
All the <span class="material">sands</span> you will cast, must withstand fire very well, it must withstand high temperature without spoiling anything.
 
It is difficult to grind <span class="material">stone alum</span>, and it cannot be sieved, you must grind it on a <span class="tool">marble slab</span>. The <span class="material">white [stone alum] powder</span> the apothecaries sell is good, it is easy to crush it into a <span class="tool">mortar</span>, use the <span class="tool">pestle</span> slowly, that way you will make it [the stone alum] very fine.
 
<span class="material">Crocum ferri</span> must be heated into a <span class="tool"><span class="profession">glassworker</span>'s furnace</span> during four <span class="time">days</span>.

Molds for fine things, like <span class="plant">wormwood</span> or something similar, can only be used once, dip the molds into <span class="material">water</span> before breaking them. Things twice reheated are dissolve easily into <span class="material">water</span>. If you don't do that your work will be hard to be stripped of the mold without being spoiled.
 
Good <span class="material">stone alum</span> is white and as shiny as white silk, this <span class="material">stone alum</span> is made of long pieces, as long as a finger, and is very fragile and woolly and fluffy. <span class="material">Stone alum</span> made of <span class="material">stone</span> is harder and not so good. The best quality can be found in <span class="place">France</span> near <span class="place">Ronan</span>. For our <span class="material">sand</span>, stone alum must be crushed into a <span class="tool">mortar</span>, and must be ground on the marble again. Don't even think about sieving it because this <span class="material">matter</span> is fat and woolly, it wouldn't pass through any <span class="tool">sieve</span> because of the very fine and soft filaments. These filaments give the <span class="material">sand</span> a much greater binding effect than <span class="material">natural wool</span> or even the <span class="material">filler the foundry owner uses</span> for big works, because <span class="material">natural wool</span> and filler burn and <span class="material">stone feather alum</span> resists fire.
 
When you cast surround the <span class="material">sand</span> of your mold with very beaten <span class="material">greasy earth</span>. Make a circle around your mold with this <span class="material">earth</span>.
 
<span class="foreign">Archanum omnibus fere reconditum est in re fusoria, v{idelicet} res exprimenda formis, sive herba sit sive animal ut lucerta, inmergatur primum in vini spiritum aprime rectificatum, deinde pulvere composito aspergatur sive illinatur (si pulvis in formam pultis redactus sit, ut assolet)</span>
 
When you want to mold something hollow, the core must be made of the same matter, if the <span class="animal">snake</span> or the animal is curved or folded you must do your core in several pieces.
 
Try [to see] if <span class="material">distilled vinegar</span> is good for eating away, it will dissolve the animal inside the hollow mold.
 
> *at left top  margin of folio 107v*
> 
> If you know that your <span class="material">plaster</span> cannot endure fire without breaking, do not take the recipe of the mixture literally, sometimes you can add less <span class="material">stone alum</span> than above. Because <span class="material">stone alum</span> soften molds. Once reheated do not grind the <span class="material">stone alum</span> again, leave it ground as the apothecaries did. It will not prevent the cast from being neat, and will give more binder to your cast. When the mold holds the color of the brick and is reddened then it will be harder.

To hold the cores, some [people] use <span class="tool">wire</span> made of the same metal as that to be cast because it boils down and is made similarly, but when it is melted or pliant the core varies. Other [people] find it serves them better to use sharpened <span class="tool"><span class="material">iron</span> wire</span> about the borders because it holds more firmly, and having fine points it does not rise up any more than the point of a <span class="tool">needle</span> and one can apply <span class="material">gold</span> or <span class="material">silver</span> on this rather than putting it in works [where] one makes a hole in the work with a small <span class="tool">chisel</span>.
 
<span class="material">Spirits</span> prevent the <span class="material">sand</span> from bubbling and do not make little holes on the borders of the mold if the thing to be molded is very damp, the holes and farts and bubbling does not make it in the place of the mold which is thick but at the borders which are more delicate.
 
One casts ordinary <span class="material">silver</span> of the sort goldsmiths coarsely work, which is made with <span class="material">mediocre alloys</span>. And when one casts with <span class="material">solder</span>, it runs even better.
 
<span class="material">Spalt</span> is a whitish stone which can be found in <span class="place">Germany</span>, mainly in <span class="place">Augsburg</span> from which can be made the most excellent sand that can be found for [casting] <span class="material">lead</span>, <span class="material">tin</span>, <span class="material">copper</span>, <span class="material">silver</span> and <span class="material">gold</span>. And the more it is used, the better it is. It is clean for casting flat things in a frame. For rounded things, it is not as attractive [because it] does not hold in the fire as the aforementioned [things] composed of <span class="material">plaster</span>.
 
The snippings of [a] large [piece of] <span class="material">greasy leather</span> are good to cast in melted <span class="material">copper</span> and <span class="material">brass</span> because they clean it and take away from it all its filth.
