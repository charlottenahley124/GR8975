## Tanner

 
Tanners use small <span class="material">skins</span> of <span class="animal">lambs</span> and young <span class="animal">goats</span> nearly as delicate as <span class="material">parchments</span> and they keep them in some humid places and keep wetting them. When they want to print some stories on it they lay them in their molding hollows of their figure and then on top they spread some greasy fine <span class="material">earth</span> used for trimming <span class="material">wool</span> fabrics, well pressed and beaten and slightly humid and soft and then put on the <span class="material">earth</span> a small oneâ€”piece board and put the whole under a press and leave that dry there. After the earth the <span class="material">leather</span> only remains very neatly printed [missing word] of the size of a pea. And then apply on the leather two or three <span class="material">black copperas</span> and iron scale layers one after the other like the tanners do. And since this tincture is astringent and shrinks the leather will be stronger more more easily printable. Once dried stick on the reverse some <span class="material">fabric</span> with strong <span class="material">glue</span>, and by doing so one can quickly imitate big statues and very fine medals and paint them and [illegible] and are light and can be carried and last for a long time. What can be printed on a relief can be made differently and can be reheated with <span class="tool">a hot iron tool</span>.
