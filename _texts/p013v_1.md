## To recognize good azur dust for oil

 
The one that piles up in small clods and is lumpy is the best because it is finer. Also the one that is also very pale in color, because oil darkens it. Certain sophists mix them together, but you will find this out if you pour some onto a piece of paper and lay it flat and spread it with your finger since, if it is mixed, it will be found varied and so to say with light and darker stripes, but if it is whole it will be even and of one color.
