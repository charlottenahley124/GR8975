## Reheating molds

 
When your molds are reheated, and cleaned, cast as soon as possible, because if you keep your molds it will corrode and become damp. Reheat the thickest part, where the body of the <span class="animal">animal</span> is, on high position because if there is something to be burnt inside it will fall down. Mark the high part in order to recognize it.
 
Once well reheated, do not damp the outside of your mold too much because the inside must stay red when you cast.
