## Hot—worked <span class="material">steel</span> and files

 
The <span class="material">steel</span> that blacksmiths and other iron workers commonly use is not refined like that from <span class="place">Germany</span> or <span class="place">Biscay</span>, which is hardened in a <span class="material">molten iron</span> bath, but among the <span class="material">iron</span> in bars which is transported by flatboat from the forges of <span class="place">Foix</span> and elsewhere, some is harder, whiter and more refined than the rest, as it comes from the mine. And the workers choose it and use it like the other <span class="material">steel</span>. And because it consists of <span class="material">common iron</span>, they call it strong <span class="material">iron</span>. But it is not of such good quality as purified <span class="material">steel</span> like that from <span class="place">Germany</span> and <span class="place">Biscaye</span>, which is sold in small beads. Some hot—work their <span class="material">steel</span>, giving it a heating and then dipping it into a large quantity of <span class="material">water</span>, then forging it. And fine <span class="material">steel</span>, which is brittle, does break and crumble, whereas <span class="material">iron</span> can be pulled out. Thus they separate the finest <span class="material">steel</span>, which with another heating they make into a mass. The <span class="place">Germans</span> make their files from strong <span class="material">iron</span>.
