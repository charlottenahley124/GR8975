## Black varnish without fire, without disassembling harnesses or removing metal bands from chests.

 
 <span class="activity"></span>  Take <span class="material_format"><span class="material">spike lavender oil</span> varnish</span> and mix it with <span class="material">charcoal black</span> or <span class="material">lampblack</span> and, without fire, it will mix in by itself. Apply the varnish with a <span class="tool">brush</span> and it will soon be dry. <span class="material_format"><span class="material">Turpentine</span> varnish</span> would work quite well but it does not dry as quickly.
