## <span class="material">Sand</span> from a mine

 
 It wants to be well recooked for big metal objects. Some people burn it inside a <span class="tool">furnace</span> until it becomes quite black and they grind it on the <span class="tool">porphyry</span>. Other people burn it with <span class="material">asphalt</span>, but when it is too burned, it does not mold so cleanly, because it lacks body, and is too thin. You can give body to the sand with <span class="material">tripoli</span> or <span class="material">burned felt</span>.
