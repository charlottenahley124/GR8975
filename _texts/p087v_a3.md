## <span class="material">Sand</span> from sand pit from <span class="place">Toulouse</span>

 
  In order to use <span class="material">sand</span> from a sandpit for casting, filter it through a <span class="tool">double sieve</span>, then having mixed it with <span class="material">molten resin</span> it burns and heats, and becomes all red and hot as iron. Once it has cooled down it is completely black and can be pulverised on <span class="tool">porphyry</span> very well. Having prepared it like this and checked the smoothness of the surface with my nail, I moistened it with <span class="material">egg white</span> and beat it vigorously, until it was not a paste anymore but a powder. I found this sand to release the cast very well, and molded very clean in lead and tin with it, however it needs to be reheated and at leisure. 
 
  Others beat it strongly in a <span class="tool">mortar</span>, in small amounts at a time, thus it detaches and comes out very fine; then they bake it moderately, just enough to dry it, and then they crush it dry on <span class="tool">porphyry</span>. Thus it is made almost impalpable, and yet not too dry , and it retains the consistency and the binding quality of the earth to which it is related, and is better than when it is burnt. When you moisten it with <span class="material">egg white</span> and pass it through a <span class="tool">sponge</span> it releases very clean for a low relief, but not a figure in high relief. Considering this, since then I experimented with moistening it only with strong <span class="material">vinegar</span>. That way it releases a figure I previously had not been able to release from the mold. I think that even when you wet the finest sort with <span class="material">egg white</span>, or in a similar fashion, or the thick sort to fill chasses with <span class="material">water</span>, <span class="material">salt</span>, or <span class="material">vinegar</span>, they do not mix so well. However, given that they are of one and the same nature, and are similarly moistened, they espouse each other, and hold together. 
 
  To mold well, when your <span class="material">sands</span> are prepared, mold in one day. Bake slowly the next day, then cast the other.

>   It is necessary to choose <span class="material">sand</span> that like comes in clods and lumps, and deep down in the earth, because commonly the one near the surface is too much akin to earth, whereas the deep one is similar to rock.

>   I have sometimes molded with pure <span class="material">lead</span> cast very clean hot, and the example as well as the principal were very clean, but since the <span class="material">vinegar</span> gives it little binding, it held only for one cast.
