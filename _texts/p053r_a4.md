## Molding from paper

 
Over <span class="material">hot ashes</span>, boil some <span class="material">cotton</span> in <span class="material">aqua fortis</span> mixed with <span class="material">sal ammoniac</span> like aqua regia. And the cotton will become very fine, like powder. Then soak it with <span class="material">gummed water</span> and you will cast quite delicately.
