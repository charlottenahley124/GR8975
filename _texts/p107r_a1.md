## Catching <span class="animal">lizards</span> and <span class="animal">snakes</span>

 
Take a <span class="tool">stick</span>, pin a net with a slipknot to the top. Whistle, and move the net nearer to the head of the <span class="animal">lizard</span>, and pull when it put it's head inside the net. It is more difficult to take a <span class="animal">lizard</span> with your hands than a <span class="animal">snake</span>, because <span class="animal">lizards</span> bite without letting go, and bite as strong as pincers.
 
You can take <span class="animal">snakes</span> with your hand, but cover your handle with a <span class="tool">woollen cloth</span>, because the teeth of the <span class="animal">snake</span> could go through a <span class="tool">common cloth</span>. You can recognize dangerous <span class="animal">snakes</span> by their blue eyes. They do not bite into <span class="material">water</span>, as it is known by <span class="profession"><span class="animal">crayfish</span> catchers</span>.
