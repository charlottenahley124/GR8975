## <span class="animal">Mussels</span>

 
There is nothing better for opening them up than to oil them with <span class="material">olive oil</span>, and nothing else. And afterwards, when you want to separate them, soak them in cold <span class="material">water</span>; that is the secret. And you will see that the <span class="material">oil</span>, although it seems to be imbued, will separate itself from the <span class="material">water</span> as does <span class="material">grease</span>. <span class="animal">Mussels</span> become stronger in cold <span class="material">water</span>, and warm <span class="material">water</span> would dissolve them with difficulty, although having been reheated, the <span class="animal">mussels</span> are then more handleable and easy to dissolve in the <span class="material">water</span>.
