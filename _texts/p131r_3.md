## Adorning beds, mirrors and similar things

 
 Model any drawing in half relief on a flat slate in order to set it on round or flat things. Cast with very fine tin, then you can gild it with gold leaf, and set it wherever you want. Fill the bottom of the relief with small rubies, orpiment, or any colored little grains.
