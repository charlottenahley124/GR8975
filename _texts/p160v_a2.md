## Fine work made of gold or silver

 
You can mold <span class="material">flies</span> by <span class="tool">hand</span>, without casting; the <span class="material">wings</span> and the <span class="material">feet</span> can be soldered, which you could not do with fine works of <span class="material">lead or tin</span>, because they would melt. You can enamel the work made of gold.
