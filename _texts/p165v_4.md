## Lute

 
When reheating, you might as well use common <span class="material">lute</span>, But when you want to cast, strip it from the <span class="material">mold</span> and, using a <span class="tool">brush</span>, quickly apply a layer of plaster <span class="material">lute</span> that has been used for molds, because it will be dry as soon as it settles, and cast. This <span class="material">lute</span> should be mainly placed on the joints.
