## Aqua fortis

 
Some put on for four pounds of <span class="material">aqua fortis matter</span> four that is in the retort, four ounces of common <span class="material">water</span> in the container, which is better than putting it into the retort. The <span class="material">alum</span> is de—phlegmed & calcined such that the water does not have as many dregs. Many make it without de—phlegming the alum.
