## <span class="material">Sand</span>

 
 <span class="material">Calcined black pebbles</span> from the river are good <span class="sup">to use</span> for <span class="material">lead</span>. But they are weakened if used with metal. 
 
 There is only <span class="material">ardille clay</span> with which one can make tiles, recooked and reddened and passed through a long narrow bag carefully soaked with <span class="material">raw egg white</span>. 
 
 Willow <span class="material">charcoal</span> is excellent with <span class="material">sand</span> <span class="sup">and</span> <span class="material">lead</span>. 
 
 <span class="material">Latten flows</span> better.
