## Spirits

 
<span class="material">Spirits</span> are excellent for making molds clean, in such a way that where you do not apply some, <span class="material">common sand</span> will attack the figure. But it needs to be passed three times. And because it does not take well on oiled things, I believe it may be best to put some into the <span class="material">water</span> with which you have moistened your <span class="material">sand</span>.
