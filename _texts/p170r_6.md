## How to clean closed molds

 
<span class="activity">You have to leave them cool down rather than blow inside to clean them, because they hold the ashes when they are hot. Once cooled, they are easier to clean. Have a find <span class="material">brass wire</span> or <span class="material">steel wool</span> to thoroughly clean the <span class="material">guene</span> because it is through it that you cast. Blow into it and siphon, bringing it to you. Give it volume before casting the <span class="material">tail</span> with <span class="material">wax</span>, then cut it.</span>
 <span class="figure"></span> <span class="figure"></span> 
make a tail by soldering a <span class="material">latten wire</span>. The grains of a flower are quite little, so they can be removed with the chaple, but the leafs need to be peeled off correctly, then the <span class="material">paint</span> will cover everything.
