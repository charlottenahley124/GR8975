## How to clean closed molds

 
You have to leave them cool down rather than blow inside to clean them, because they hold the ashes when they are hot. Once cooled, they are easier to clean. Have a find brass wire or steel wool to thoroughly clean the guene because it is through it that you cast. Blow into it and siphon, bringing it to you. Give it volume before casting the tail with wax, then cut it.

make a tail by soldering a latten wire. The grains of a flower are quite little, so they can be removed with the chaple, but the leafs need to be peeled off correctly, then the paint will cover everything.
