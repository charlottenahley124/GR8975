## <span class="tool">Mortars</span>

 
 They should be of the finest material possible. In the same way, it is better to use <span class="material">copper</span> for a <span class="tool">cauldron</span> than <span class="material">red copper</span>, because it better resists a blow. 
 
 The <span class="tool">mortars</span>, therefore, used for grinding are stronger and there is less danger of breaking them if they are of fine <span class="material">copper</span>. And for a private home, they do not ring so much and do not make as much noise as those of metal. It is true that those that are of metal ring louder for <span class="profession">apothecaries</span>. 
 
 Grenades must be made from fine metal
