## Making varnish

 
 Take some <span class="material">mastic</span>, @<span class="material">sandarac</span>, <span class="material">gum arabic</span>, and <span class="material">aspic oil</span>, as much of one as the other, and melt them all together. Before coating it, lay a coat of quite clear <span class="material">glue</span> and let it dry.
