## <span class="material">Tin</span> casting

 
If the <span class="plant">herbage</span> or <span class="plant">flower</span> you want to cast is delicate and fine, <span class="material">tin</span> must exceed <span class="material">lead</span> in your mixture; on the contrary, if it the <span class="plant">flower</span> or herbage is thick, you must add into your mixture more <span class="material">lead</span> than <span class="material">tin</span>. For a fine thing, add one part of <span class="material">tin</span> for four parts of <span class="material">lead</span>. Your mold must not be too hot, so you can hold it with your hand when you cast. Your alloyed <span class="material">tin</span> must be very hot and almost red for casting, and that way it will enter all the small parts of the mold. Otherwise, your <span class="material">tin</span> will cool down before reaching the thin parts of your <span class="plant">herbage</span>. Do not forget to mix a little <span class="material">bismuth</span> in your mixture; that way, your <span class="material">tin</span> will run better and be firmer.

> With your <span class="material">lead</span> allied with <span class="material">tin</span>, or <span class="material">tin</span> allied with <span class="material">lead</span>, you can add a very little quantity of <span class="material">bismuth</span> and it will look silvery. But do not put too much, because if hardens the matter and makes it sour, and if your work on fine things —— like legs and similar things —— it will not cast properly.
