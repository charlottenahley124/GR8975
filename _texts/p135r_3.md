## <span class="plant">Vine leaf</span> and small frog

 
 To mold, take <span class="plant">vine leaves</span> as they are blooming, just as with all herbs & flowers, or a young <span class="plant">vine</span> regrowing after it has been cut or when the leaves come off in autumn, because new leaves are knottier & have more evident veins. By contrast, old leaves are smooth all the way through & full of holes in many places. Place therefore your leaf, its back behind it against the <span class="material">clay plaster</span>, and fasten it with little <span class="tool">pins</span>. Leave it nevertheless with its natural curling. And make a notch in the <span class="material">clay</span> to hide the stem for the first cast. And when it's done and dry, take out the stem of the leaf and clean it well with your jacket and press it with a little scoop of <span class="material">clay</span>. Afterwards, make many castings around the leaf with <span class="material">wax</span>, as you know well, & make a slender casting & with many lines & knots.
