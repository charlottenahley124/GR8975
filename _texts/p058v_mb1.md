> <span class="material">Enamel azur</span> hates more than any other to be ground, even with some <span class="material">water</span> for it dies and loses all its color. Because however it cannot be used if it is big, grind it not with some water but with some oil and grind it thickly and so it will not die
 
Always choose the thinnest one
