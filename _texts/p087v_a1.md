## <span class="material">Sand</span>, <span class="material">salte</span>, and <span class="material">burned earth</span>

 
 <span class="material">Sand</span>, when overheated, does not hold as well. <span class="material">Slate</span> is baked and will mold clean, yet it is true that often it becomes porous, just like <span class="material">burned earth</span> also does, as well as any kind of greasy <span class="material">sand</span>.

>  I find that one must not hammer at all on <span class="material">sand</span> already very finely pulverised, because it would damage it, and then make the <span class="material">sand</span> would not be able to release the cast cleanly. Still, it needs to be pressed hard, and moisten it sufficiently.
