##  <span class="material">Lead tin</span> 

 
They crack if they are often melted again and thicken and burn, so that even if a salmon is made, the <span class="material">tin</span> becomes thick at the bottom if it is not stirred often during casting. It is better for casting to melt some <span class="material">lead</span> and some <span class="material">tin</span> and to renew it each time. The <span class="material">antimony</span> makes them breakable, the <span class="material">iced tin</span> makes them whiter. Pewterers mix a pound of <span class="material">iced tin</span> with a quintal of <span class="material">fine tin</span> and two and a half or three pounds of <span class="material">red, mild cauldron copper</span>, which is better than <span class="material">latten.</span> There is <span class="material">fine and mild tin</span> and <span class="material">sour tin</span>. Pewterers cast the sour as grills to sell it better. They go better and more cleanly in <span class="material">stone</span> moulds than in <span class="material">copper</span> molds because <span class="material">copper</span> is fat and draws the <span class="material">mild tin</span> when heated. Or when casting a large work, three quarts of <span class="material">lead</span> with one pound of <span class="material">mild tin</span> produces a very liquid mixture which is appropriate for casting and is as shiny as a mirror. Laxunge <span class="material">glass</span> lightens them. All things that lighten <span class="material">metals</span> a lot and remove their thickness and natural density and make them as liquid as water make them appropriate for casting because their thickness stops them from flowing. The <span class="material">mild tin</span> is more even than the <span class="material">sour tin</span>, which is whiter and seems to have been polished like a mirror.
