## <span class="material">Sand</span> for <span class="material">lead</span>

 
 Recipe: Take grey <span class="material">soot</span> from the silversmiths' <span class="tool">furnace</span>, <span class="material">quick lime</span>, and <span class="material">flour</span>. Moisten according to [the rules of] the art, in the finest possible way you can.

>  The locksmiths' grey <span class="material">soot</span> which is held in their forge is quite fine when ground. It molds and is removed very neatly.
