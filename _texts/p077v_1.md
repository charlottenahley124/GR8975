## Other approved varnishes

 
 Take two ounces of <span class="material">linnen oil</span>, and two ounces of <span class="material">petrol oil</span>, and two ounces of <span class="material">mastic</span>, the whitest you can find, and of <span class="material">roche alum</span> and crush it and take a little bit of <span class="material">white copperoze</span> and put all these drugs together into an <span class="tool">earthen pot</span>, which should be new. Put it for a while on <span class="tool">hot ashes</span> and you will have a beautiful varnish.
