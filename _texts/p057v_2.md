## Painter

 
Good <span class="material">crayons</span> are not made with <span class="material">glue</span> but with <span class="material">women's milk</span>.
 
Images made of <span class="material">card</span> have to be dipped in some very fine and clarified melted <span class="material">rosin</span> once they have dried. This strengthens them or they will turn flaccid in wet weather.
 
<span class="place">Venice</span> masks are made with a molding hollow and the face covered with <span class="material">copper</span>.
 
The Flemish do not use other white colors for <span class="material">oil</span> painted skin colors after some <span class="material">white lead</span> for the <span class="material">ceruse</span> turns them yellow.
 
The 4 or 5 years old and clear <span class="material">nut oil</span> is the best antiâ€”dust color. The one slowly squeezed from the press similar to <span class="material">almond oil</span> is white even if the <span class="material">nuts' skin</span> is peeled off.

You must make at least three layers of flesh color in order to paint faces in <span class="material">oil</span>. And to begin, one places the black and shadow where it is appropriate. After, the highlighting with <span class="material">lead white</span> must not be placed on the black. Flesh colors and [missing word] containing <span class="material">ceruse</span> will yellow in five or six months, but <span class="material">lead white</span> does not change.
 
<span class="material"><span class="place">Florence</span> lake</span> is better than <span class="material">lake</span> from <span class="place">Flanders</span> because in <span class="place">Florence</span> they make the best dyes. To make a beautiful flesh color, the reddest and brightest <span class="material">lake</span> is the best, because those that are purple and violet as a result of the addition of too much <span class="material">alum</span> look like the flesh of someone that is very cold. That is why women who want to color their cheeks crush <span class="material"><span class="place">Florence</span> lake</span> very finely, then fill a little <span class="material">cotton</span> with it, which they then wrap in a little fine <span class="material">cambric</span>. And thus they rub the <span class="material">lake</span> on their cheeks and then, with another clean <span class="material">cotton</span>, they soften it.
 
<span class="material">Crystallin</span> having been crushed in <span class="material">water</span> appears to have body, but in <span class="material">oil</span> it does not have any. It is crushed with <span class="material">lake</span> and with <span class="material">bitumen</span>, which would not dry for a very long time otherwise.
 
<span class="material">Aspic oil</span> is commonly put with <span class="material">lead white</span>, not entirely pure but mixed with a little <span class="material">walnut oil</span>. The said <span class="material">aspic oil</span> will not be good for <span class="material">lake</span> and colors that do not have body because it will make them crack, but with those that have body and are somewhat greasy, it is quite appropriate.
 
<span class="material">Verdigris</span> and <span class="material">orpiment</span> must be first crushed with <span class="material">urine</span> rather than thinned with <span class="material">oil</span>. Thus they are beautiful and do not fade.
