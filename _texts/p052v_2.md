## Colors

 
If you want to keep them moist and prevent them from losing their initial color, pour some <span class="material">white wine</span>, the whitest and the clearest you can in a bottle with some <span class="material">tragacanth gum</span>, and once you have corked the bottle, mix and shake it very strongly, and leave it still until the tragacanth is dissolved. Add also some fine white earth to lighten that. Some mingle the white wine with some spring water, and with this composition they mix their colors without grinding them, and they show very beautifully on miniature works.
