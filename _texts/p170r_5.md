## Thick tin pieces

 
<span class="activity">They should not be casted with <span class="material">lead</span> or red <span class="material">tin</span>, like thin and fragile things. It is enough if they are well melted and hot. <span class="material">Fragile things</span> need to be red hot and made of red tin.</span>
