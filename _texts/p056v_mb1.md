> Someone who operates with <span class="material">oil</span> will not work properly with <span class="material">distemper</span> if he has not been trained well during his youth. The manner of working is indeed very different because the brush point always has to be moisten for working with <span class="material">distemper</span>. While when one cleans the brush in some <span class="material">oil</span> to soften it, one should dry it well. Otherwise the work would drip and soon be damaged.
