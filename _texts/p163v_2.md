## Crocum

 
<span class="activity">That which has become rusty by itself, having been doused with <span class="material">water</span>, <span class="material">salt</span>, and either <span class="material">vinegar or urine</span>, and then wellâ€”dried and reddened by heating, is deep red when crushed on porphyry and is of the color of bol de levant, almost like minium. But that which is doused with <span class="material">urine</span> and dried acquires a deeper color and almost like crushed aes ustum or like vermillion. But the first one, finely crushed, acquires a bright red color like cinnabar when placed in spirits. And the one and the other, when prepared as said above, finely ground and made very hot, produce a red smoke like an acid vapor if, being thus hot and fine, one throws vinegar, urine or spirits on top. The <span class="material">urine</span> makes a lot of color and the <span class="material">spirits</span> as well.</span>
