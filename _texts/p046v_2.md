## Shoemaker

 
If he wants to do some tanned work on black <span class="material">leather</span> shoes, he can dip in <span class="material">oil of sulfur</span> a writing quill and paint with it what he would like on shoes, boots, and colets. And he will obtain a reddish color which no effort will erase. Urb.
