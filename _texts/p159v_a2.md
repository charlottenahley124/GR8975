## Carnation

 
Mold a carnation like a <span class="material">rose</span>, <span class="material">marigold</span>, and all other <span class="material">flowers</span> as discussed, that is to say cast the flowers in one mold, and the leaves in two parts in order to solder them onto the flower, this is the better way. But you could mold the flower and the leaves together in one single closed mold. I tried one which came out well from the mold. But the sand must be very thin, and you must blow very strongly.
