## Copying off patterns

 
Make some <span class="material">soap water</span> and with it, rub and moisten the <span class="material">engraved stone</span> that you want to transfer the pattern from, then lay a white sheet of <span class="material">paper</span> on it and rub strongly against it with a sharp piece or the bottom of a <span class="material">glass</span> bottle and you will transfer your stamped piece. It is true that it will be on the left side, but if you apply <span class="material">aspic</span> or <span class="material">turpentine oil</span> on your <span class="material">paper</span>, it will be stamped on the right on the other side. Then trace these lines with a paint brush or a quill, then heat the <span class="material">paper</span> and the <span class="material">oil</span> will evaporate and it will leave your <span class="material">paper</span> white. And if you don't want that to be known if, by chance, you borrowed the <span class="material">cut stone</span>, soak the <span class="material">paper</span> and the polishing that the polisher made on the back side, which distinguishes what has been made, will not be recognizable. The <span class="material">soap water</span> will turn the piece yellow, but well <span class="material">gummed wate</span>r, which has the same effect, does not do this. If you want to, for the same effect, make <span class="material">gummed wate</span>r then, dissolve some <span class="material">soap</span> in it and do as is said.
