## Imitation diamonds set into the work 

 
 Spread a fine layer of imprinting black wax on the inside of the frame then coat it inside with wheat oil, then dust it with lamp smoke because this color should not be lustrous for fake stones. Having done this, set your stone with a piece of wax then, with a steel point, or a small finishing hammer, join the edge of the frame with the stone, so that light cannot get in but be careful not to hit the stone, which would break.
