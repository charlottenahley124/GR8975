## Painting weapons

 
<span class="material">Black charcoal</span> mixed with <span class="material">white lead</span> is very appropriate for painting weapons, also mixing in a little <span class="material">azure</span> if you wish. <span class="material">Charcoal</span> by itself is somewhat bluish.
