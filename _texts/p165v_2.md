## Keeping animals

 
Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again, put them back into the mixture of <span class="material">urine</span>, <span class="material">vinegar</span> and <span class="material">spirits</span> where you killed the others, and they will keep for a long time without decaying. If you have a cut on your hand, take care that this mixture does not touch it.
