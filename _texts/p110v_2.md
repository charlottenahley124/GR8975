## Wheat oil

 
Is made on a <span class="tool">blade</span> of <span class="material">iron</span> reddened in the fire, and the <span class="material">oil</span> turns into drops, which is appropriate to <span class="material">oil</span> the hair of a <span class="animal">butterfly</span> or similar thing, because this <span class="material">oil</span> is instantly dry and makes the rest dry out. It is necessary that the coat or down of any animal that you want to mold be flat, because if left standing up, it will make the <span class="material">sand</span> raise up and form bubbles.

>  # If you want to mold something delicate, like a <span class="plant">pansy</span>, some, to give it a little thickness, more than what is natural, some rub it with <span class="material">butter</span>. But it is best to oil it with <span class="material">wheat oil</span> because it has no opacity and does not block the smaller features as much, and makes the <span class="plant">flower</span> firmer.
