## Carton

 
 It is necessary to take <span class="material">paper</span> from <span class="place">Florence</span>, which is the finest, and crush it and and soak it several times and change the <span class="material">water</span> every day, that way it does not smell bad. And after having moulded it into the hollow, put a <span class="tool">cloth</span> over it, and from the back side, rub the back of your <span class="material">paper</span> with a sharp piece, as if you wanted to polish it and it will mould very neat. Then glue some <span class="tool">cloth</span> from the back side with strong <span class="material">glue</span>.
