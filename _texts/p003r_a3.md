## Thick <span class="material">varnish</span> for floorboards

 <span class="activity"></span>  
There is a type of <span class="material">varnish</span> that takes a long time to dry and is still damp up to two <span class="time">months</span> after it has been applied to the floorboards. But the following <span class="material">varnish</span> does not remain damp like previous ones, which were made of <span class="material">linseed oil from Aux</span> boiled with <span class="material">garlic</span> to extinguish them and rid them of <span class="material">fat</span>, and also with <span class="material">wheat</span>. And this old one yellowed over time and made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like former <span class="material">varnishes</span> except that one puts in <span class="material">common thick turpentine</span>.
