## Another varnish

 
 Take one ounce of <span class="material">spike lavender oil</span> and heat it over <span class="tool">coals</span>; take a half ounce of <span class="material">sandarac</span> and grind it coarsely, and then put it in the <span class="material">spike lavender oil</span> and mix it with a stick until it has melted, and then put it in a <span class="tool">glass vial</span>, and when you want to use it needs to be heated little by little over the <span class="tool">coals</span>, and before applying, lay a coat of very clear <span class="material">glue</span>, and then apply it with a <span class="tool">paintbrush</span>.
