## Giving ventilation to your mold

 
If your <span class="plant">herbage</span> is very fine, in addition to vents, you can drive a thread through the <span class="material">clay</span> contour of your <span class="plant">herbage</span> instead of casting with a <span class="tool">needle</span>, and thread it also in the <span class="plant">herbage</span>. The thread will burn, like the <span class="plant">herbage</span>, and the hole will remain, thus giving extra ventilation.

> Do not remove your annealed molds out of the fire before they have cooled down by themselves. Also make sure that your very hot molds do not come into contact with wind or coldness otherwise they would burst. Do not reheat your molds before they are drained and firm again, otherwise they would cast before the vent holes are made and the <span class="tool">clamps</span> are fixed.
