<span class="material">Mortars</span> are made of the best alloy of <span class="material">"métal"</span> and the finest possible <span class="material">rosette</span> so that they do not burst, that is to say one part "métal" and two [parts] fine rosette or <span class="material">old caudron</span>, which is even better. Some of them are of <span class="unit">fifteen or seventeen lb.</span> and are loaded with <span class="unit">two and a half lb.</span> of <span class="material">grain powder</span>, and they are put on common windows and doors. Others are of a weight of <span class="unit">25 to 27 lb.</span> and are loaded with <span class="unit">eight lb.</span> of <span class="material">powder</span>. And in such a way, they are made according to the stress they have to resist. On the outside, they are all the same shape, but in the inside, they are made like a crucible

narrower on the inside of the bottom and getting wider towards the mouth. And this is to reinforce the bottom, given the quantity of <span class="material">powder</span> they hold, and so that they do not burst. Those of <span class="unit">4 s. lb.</span> are eight lines thick at the bottom, and get thinner in the inside towards the opening, which is of 4 lines. They have <span class="unit">xiii "poulsses"</span> long and <span class="unit">seven in diameter</span> at the mouth and opening.

The ones weighing about <span class="unit">27 lb.</span> are <span class="unit">ix "pousses" long</span> and the mouth is <span class="unit">6 [pousses]</span> in diameter. At their bottom, they are <span class="unit">6 "lignes"</span> thick, and <span class="unit">3</span>for the mouth. The ones weighing <span class="unit">17 lb</span> are <span class="unit">8 "poulsses"</span> long and the mouth is <span class="unit">five</span>. They are all covered together, all the <span class="material">forks</span>, <span class="material">rods</span>, and tools which one uses, with a big <span class="tool">canvas</span> or big <span class="tool">cloth</span> so that they do not make any noise. It is good that they sit loaded for a while. After the <span class="material">powder</span> has been put in, it is grinded very hard and then tightly pressed paper is put in, then a cake of well pressed <span class="material">wax</span> and, on the wax, another slab of <span class="material">cork</span> that fits in very snugly and that you have to force in. In this way, the powder remains well packed and gives much greater force, and if you wish, you can put on the cork slab one of <span class="material">wood</span> pierced in the middle, if the mortar has a pierced bottom, which is believed to be the easiest and which makes a greater hole because it cannot recoil. And for these that have a pierced bottom, one must have a good gimlet to first make the hole so that the rod, which is made by the point of the gimlet, has before and without noise attached the mortar. And for these, one must cover the button, which is quite sharply filed, with waxed canvas, or add <span class="material">wax</span> to it so that it completely plugs the hole in the bottom. But because the doors are sometimes iron and the <span class="material">iron rods</span> cannot pierce it, an iron fork made like pincers and another iron stick made with three claws, like you see painted, are use. And in this way, the mortar stays in place well and is immediately steadied. The iron rods must come out of the mortar from every point made by the gimlet, namely by <span class="unit">three or 4 finger lengths</span>, which all enter in the door. When the mortars are placed, the touch—hole is filled with good powder and inserted in it is a feather shaft filled with tightly pressed powder and moistened with <span class="material">vinegar</span>, or if needed, the powder is firmly pressed with the palms of the hands and, having wet it with some saliva, you shape it like a cocoon or

rod that we put into the touch—hole, and then, with a <span class="material">rope</span> wrapped around the end of a <span class="material">baston</span>, we ignite it and promptly retreat to take cover. The small mortars of <span class="unit">16 or 17 lb.</span> are attached promptly with a short, hooked rod made like a wimble, and if it is of a good alloy, we can ignite it by hand. It is done in this way for mortars of <span class="unit">27 lb.</span>, but then we only put <span class="unit">three lb.</span> of powder. The door really needs to be strong so as not to be blown off for <span class="unit">seventeenth lb.</span> mortars. Some people use little bells worn by oxen or mules as an door for the mortars. Others load two canons of <span class="material">guns</span> and, with a <span class="material">gimlet</span> and a string, tie them with the opening against the door. If the mortars are good and do not explode, they only recoil and cannot harm if one is next to them.
 
 
- {:.indent-3}A is a <span class="material">small rod</span>, hooked like the hinge of a door and made as a <span class="material">biron</span> on one end in order to quickly attach a small mortar with handles of fifteen or xvii lb. for a common door or window.
 
- {:.indent-3}B is a <span class="material">small mortar</span> with handles.
 
- {:.indent-3}C is a <span class="material">common mortar</span> of <span class="unit">27 or 30 lb</span>. pierced at the bottom, where a large iron rod passes, button—like on one end made like a biron on the tip so as to quickly hang the mortar against a door that will not be covered with iron plates.
 
- {:.indent-3}D These are slabs of <span class="material">wax</span>, <span class="material">cork</span> and <span class="material">wood</span> for loading the mortar and well packing the powder.
 
- {:.indent-3}E <span class="tool">iron fork</span> made in the form of pincers as tall as a man, used to quickly set the mortar without a rod. It must be of soft iron so that the sides fold easily, if needed, and to accommodate the height or width of the door.
 
- {:.indent-3}F is another <span class="tool">iron fork</span> of the same height that supports the fork made as pincers and also sustains the mortar, and with its low claw prevents the pincers from recoiling.

- {:.indent-3}G <span class="material">mortar with handles</span> placed with its rod.
 
- {:.indent-3}H knife—like <span class="tool">saws</span> to cut, if needed, a <span class="tool">portcullis</span>.
 
- {:.indent-3}J the <span class="tool">big iron rods</span> that cross and tie the mortar.
 
- {:.indent-3}K are like <span class="tool">iron rods</span>, all round and covered with cloths, like all the rest, so as to make the big iron rods, pierced close to the button, turn.
 
- {:.indent-3}L <span class="tool">axes</span> that one must always carry to chop and to break, in the fortuitous case that the mortar has left anything entirely.
 
- {:.indent-3}M a large wood <span class="tool">mallet</span> for knocking down what was begun and weakened by the axes and "birons".
 
- {:.indent-3}N are big <span class="tool">wheelwright augers</span> and <span class="tool">birons</span> for easily cutting a door or window by making large holes close to one another.
 
- {:.indent-3}O <span class="material">crutches</span> as tall as a man that must be carried to put under a portcullis immediately after the canon has been shot and to prevent the portcullis from falling.
 
- {:.indent-3}P are small <span class="tool">iron pincers</span> for putting any low mortar against the bolt of a door.
