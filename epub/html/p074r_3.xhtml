         for the space of five hours. You will take half an ounce of flour glue, and will make it boil just as before, and stir continuously with a spoon. And then afterwards, you will add two ounces of well-pounded sandarac to it, and will do so as above. And then afterwards, you will take mastic and gum arabic, two ounces of each, both well pounded, and will put everything together, and will
         have it boil, always stirring, for the space of five hours. And then you will add

      <p>fire until it is cooked enough. And strain it through a cloth that is compact enough. And when you have strained it, leave it to cool a little.
         And if you see that it is so thick that you cannot strain it, you will add a little
         of that oil and will make it better.
