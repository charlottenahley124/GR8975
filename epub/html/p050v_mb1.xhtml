      <p>Steel is applied to tools not on both sides, but underneath the part where one sharpens
         and whets
         them, and this part must be made of very soft iron.

      <p>Levantines refine our own steel because their country provides them with none, and they reheat
         it in
         a pot with bitumen etc.
