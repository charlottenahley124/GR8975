      <h3>To cast in sulfur</h3>
      
      
      <p> To cast neatly in sulfur, arrange the pith of
         bread under the brazier, as you know. Mold whatever
         you want into it &amp; let it dry &amp; you will have very neat work. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p> Try sulfur passed through
         melted wax, because it will no longer ignite &amp; and make
         eyelets. 
      </p>
