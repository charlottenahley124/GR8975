      <h3>Skin colors</h3>
      
      <p>It is necessary that you make it of two kinds, one more
         red to make the main layer, the other more pale for the highlights, as
         around the eyes. And then on this last skin color, you will touch lightly the main
         lights
         with a little white lead. But avoid applying too much of it because
         this will look like a face of death. The beautiful Florence lacquer
         makes a beautiful vivid skin color that resembles the complexion of alexandrine
         pink and incarnadine
      </p>. 
      <p> Certain colors need to be ground like minium or massicot. The
         ashes don't need to be ground at all.
