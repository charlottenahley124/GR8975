      <h3>Founders of small tin work</h3>

         They usually cast from soft solder the things that should not become hollow, because hollow works require fine and soft tin. However, these things would not otherwise lose their coat or become hollow if they
         are mixed or include glass tin  in them, just like they mix a little glass tin in the soft tin. They carve their work on stones of which the sharpening stones or barber's files are made. These are found in great
         flakes near the mountains, and resemble slate. They are found in three colors: one reddish, that is not as perfect as the others
         because it does not sustain heat ; another one  is the color of dark slate, and the other is whitish. When they work a relief, first they print it on carton, which is one finger thick, to serve as a pattern. After planing their stones and rubbing them together , they use a compass or little iron tools to carve their figures. They make their molds with three or four stones, to make a circle or a square with the stones which join perfectly because the stones are of equal size. Before casting, they rub the mould over with tallow, and it the mould absorbs it quickly because it is hot. Then, having put fine powder of quicklime into a cloth, they rub the mould using pounce in beating the linen on top, then blow it a little on top; this prevents bubbles from forming. The main thing is to make some vents. If the work is big, they do as it is shown
         on the picture. They make a hole in the medal, somewhere where it is least visible, and with a bit they pierce the mold on the
         side of the medal.
