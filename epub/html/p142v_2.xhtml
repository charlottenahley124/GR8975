      <h3>Molds</h3>
      
      
      
      <p>Make some notches in them the molds that enter more into the inside of
         the mold than the outside because in this way, they have more strength. Take care
         to keep from
         reheating them suddenly in a burning hot fire, because this will make them break.
         
      </p>
      
      
      <p> Do not keep them molds in a humid place, nor an
         enclosed place if they are not well dry, because they will mold. The same with dried
         animals. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p> It is not at all necessary to reheat the molds
         two times when the animal can pull away without burning, as do toads, which can very
         well be
         molded hollow like all thick animals. However, it is always good to redden the mold
         once.
