      <h3>Molding and shrinking a large shape</h3>
      
      
      <p> Mold it with the pith of bread just out of the
         oven, or like that aforementioned, &amp; in drying out it will shrink &amp; consequently so
         will the medal that you will cast. By these means - lengthening out or
         enlarging the imprinted bread - you can vary the shape &amp; from one
         face make several different ones. The bread straight from the oven is best. And the
         one
         which has been heated twice contracts more. You can cast sulfur without
         letting the imprint on the bread dry, if you want to cast it as large as it is. But,
         if you
         want to let it shrink, let it dry to a greater or lesser extent.
