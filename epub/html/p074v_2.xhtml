      <h3>To make yellow varnish</h3>
      
      
      <p>Take some gum arabic and let it soak in water, then take some well beaten saffran and soak said gum. And make it quite light, then make your ground layer on that which
         you want to varnish, and leave it to dry, and when it will be dry give another ground
         layer of the same varnish, and leave it to dry as before, until it will be dry enough. Then take varnish from
         an apothecary, crushed by strokes far enough from one another. Then wash your hands quite well
         and spread your varnish with their palms.
