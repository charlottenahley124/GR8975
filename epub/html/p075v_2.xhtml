      <p>First of all it is necessary to apply a coat of very clear glue; and
         when it is dry, you will apply a coat of yellow gold; and when this is done
         you will take fig tree wood and soak it for a while, and wash the place you
         want to gild,dhdjhjdhdjh and cut your gold with a knife near where you will put it; and said
         gold must be applied with cotton, and if you can find some fig tree, take an
         egg white and stir it frequently.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If your gold does not have a nice enough color, you will take a partridge
         feather burn it in a chafing-dish, and turn the smoke toward what you
         have gilded.
