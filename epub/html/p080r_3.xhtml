      <p>If you wish to raise water higher than its source, make a pipe descend as in A. to B. to give it push , then from B. to C. make the pipe ascend, but not quite to the height of the source, here represented by the dotted
         line, and then make it descend again in a pipe from C. to D., and then let it rise higher than the line demarcating the height of
         the source, and do this successively until you reach the desired height. Remark nonetheless
         that the length of the descending pipe is always twice as long as the ascending pipe. This cone also fills itself and demonstrates a perpetual fountain which you can
         adapt into a rock, attracting the water with which it is filled by the tip here marked,
         by sucking and breathing in. You can also make a watering can pipe in this way, so
         long as the bent pipe is just as long as the straight pipe, but does not extend as
         far down.
