    <block position="left-top">Someone who operates with <material>oil</material> will not work
        properly with <material>distemper</material> if he has not been trained well during his
        youth. The manner of working is indeed very different because the brush point always has to
        be moisten for working with <material>distemper</material>. While when one cleans the brush
        in some <material>oil</material> to soften it, one should dry it well. Otherwise the work
        would drip and soon be damaged.</block>
