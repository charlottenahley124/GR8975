    <block>To dry jams that are [not?] liquid, have an open <tool>tub</tool> pierced on each side with a small,
        square window, and pass <tool>sticks</tool> through these from one side to the other, and place on these
        a sieve made of <tool>strings</tool> in the form of a net. And on this, you will neatly put your jam
        containers. And having put at the bottom of the tub a <tool>hot coal</tool> or two, cover the tub with a
        <tool>cloth</tool> folded in two.</block>
