    <block position="left-bottom">To work properly on small scale you need some very fine brushes
        with a strong point. And because the <material>hair</material> taken from a
            <animal>squirrel</animal>'s tale is mollesin, the most careful ones use the of oldest
                <material><animal>rats</animal>' hair</material> and even of
            <animal>dormouses</animal> if they can find some and put two or three in the middle of a
        brush. These brushes draw a straight line like a quill and all the other hairs stick to
        them. The <material>hair of a <animal>stone marten</animal></material> or of a
            <animal>weasel</animal> and small animals used to make some <material>musk</material>
        are even better for just one <material>hair</material> is necessary in a brush</block>
